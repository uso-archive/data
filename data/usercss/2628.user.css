@name         Mark Shuttleworth's Blog - Limit Entry Length
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Amanda Kerik
@description  Mark Shuttleworth is the top guy at the company (Canonical) that supports / spreads a version of Linux called Ubuntu.  Anyways, his blog entries tend to be long. When I'm skimming through them as opposed to reading them, the length can get annoying; this shortens each entry to a reasonable height, with scroll bar as needed.
