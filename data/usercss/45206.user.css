@name         Make icons in 'my add-ons' list the correct size

@description  For some reason (a bug?), the icons in the 'my add-ons' list are now being forcibly resized to 64x64, even though they are supposed to be 32x32 icons.  This makes them look blurry and ugly.  This style makes them 32x32 - their proper size - again.
