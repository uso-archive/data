@description  http://phpdoc.org    version 0.0.1      --[description]    Their logo and floating head/foot were cool for 5 seconds, until they got in the way of reading the pages.    The footer opens on hover.      --[series]    The "paintless" series is a collection of styles meant to be styled over.  Alone, they clean the target page(s), preparing them for further styling with hopefully the least possible selector specificity.    Writing your style to overlay this one will save you from having to include this code version in yours.  Users can load both, and they'll get my updates without needing you to notice the update.  Write your style correctly, and my updates shouldn't damage your styles.      --[relevant]    See also:  http://userstyles.org/styles/search/painted+black  http://userstyles.org/styles/search/paintless
