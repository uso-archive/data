@description  Disable Link Preview Pop-Up is a browser extension designed to enhance your browsing experience by removing the annoying link preview pop-up that appears at the bottom of the screen when hovering over hyperlinks. This extension ensures a cleaner and distraction-free browsing session, especially useful for users who find the preview pop-ups intrusive or unnecessary. By injecting custom CSS, this extension effectively hides the link preview elements, providing a smoother and more streamlined web navigation.
