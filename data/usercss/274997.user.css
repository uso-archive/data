@description  This makes the font Lentariso on every website it can do so, provided you have the font installed on your system. This style also affects code editors as well, so it may break alignment of code. In that case, you can temporarily disable the style while you are working on code.    If you do not have the Lentariso font, you can download and install it at https://github.com/Bry10022/Lentariso    Click on Code, then Download ZIP. Once the ZIP folder containing the fonts is downloaded, extract the files, then follow the usual instructions to install fonts on your system.
