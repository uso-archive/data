@description    `Do you like using WriteRoom, the distraction-free Mac-based text editor? http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroomMaybe you like JDarkroom, the cross-platform Java WriteRoom clone.Me too. But I use Google Docs to store everything and manage versions. I tried with Greasemonkey to get this to work, but now you can edit Google Docs in fullscreen mode, Stylish seems a better answer. The best thing about this is it doesn't change the background colour in the document, just your browser. You can get the same effect with Edit CSS in Docs, but it ain't the same!Be sure to press F11 to make Firefox fullscreen too. Maybe someone can figure out how to make it do the type-writer line-feed thing?`
