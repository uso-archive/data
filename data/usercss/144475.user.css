@name         Twitter: Hide likes in timeline feed
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       mildmojo
@description  Likes are not shares!    Hide other users' likes that appear in your timeline. Reduce clutter; see only the things people have posted or retweeted.

/* 
  In mid-2017 my timeline finally started including tweets
  that other people "liked". Not retweeted, just clicked "like".
  At times it was a third of my feed or more.

  Since LIKES ARE NOT SHARES (cc Facebook), this style hides them.
