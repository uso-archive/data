@name           Remember The Milk - Tag Cloud Line Spacing
@namespace      USO Archive
@author         dvdmon
@description    `Based on this excellent idea found in RTM's forum:http://www.rememberthemilk.com/forums/tips/2943/I've been using my task cloud as a nicely formatted way to get to what normally I would need a smartlist for.  Clicking on a tag creates an automatic smartlist of sorts.  It's only a one-dimensional smartlist that looks for the given tag, but having your cloud formatted in such a way makes creating things like on-the-fly context lists easy.Unfortunately this is all a hack and so you can't introduce spacing to help seperate the various sections out.  So in order to make things a bit more readable, I've created this small script which increases the line-spacing for all the lines within the cloud.`
