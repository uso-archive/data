@name           Tumblr Login/Not Found Background Disable
@namespace      USO Archive

@description    `***IMPORTANT UPDATE!! CHECK THE NOTES SECTION BELOW!!***Short script designed to eliminate the background images from tumblr logins. For some unknown reason Tumblr staff sees fit to allow flashy .gifs and incredibly bright images to display in fullscreen behind the tumblr login information, which not only makes it hard to see but can cause epileptic shock for people with photosensitivity. This script disables that background image completely and just leaves the nice blue color we all know.EDIT:Updated this morning to include disabling the background for 404 pages! If you've already installed, just click the green "Install with stylish" button below and it should update automagically.`
