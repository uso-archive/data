@description  Removes the layout of specific google sheets pages to increase how much of the sheet can be viewed at a time.  - Use the editor to add which spreadsheets you want to remove the layout for. I would recommend using url-prefix and only copying the spreadsheet link up to "edit#gid=" (numbers) so you can use it on every tab of the spreadsheet you add.  - Use fullscreen on your browser for maximum effect.  - You may want to add hyperlinks to your spreadsheet if you are using multiple tabs.  - If you need to edit the spreadsheet, disable the style then enter + exit fullscreen mode in either order.  - By default, this affects my "Hunting set search list" which does have hyperlinks and my "Sheet Engine".
