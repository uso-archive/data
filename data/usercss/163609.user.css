@description  This is literally just one very short line that changes the width of the column where the toot writing thing is. But since it took me about a year to stop being annoyed by the overly lorge column and take the two minutes to make myself this style, I figured some other people might appreciate me sharing it.  <p> Click "customize settings" and add your instance (without the https://). You can also change the exact smolness of the column.
