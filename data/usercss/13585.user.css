@description  This style forces all text on a website to be the size that is configured in your browser preferences. Once you've installed this style it's recommended that you open your preferences and play around with your default font size until you have it at a size that is comfortable for you.    Depending on the size that you choose, some websites (especially badly coded ones) could break when this style is active.    Suggestions for improvement are very welcome.
