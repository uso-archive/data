@name           GMail 2 Remove the star system
@namespace      USO Archive
@author         Thomas Baruchel
@description    `This style removes four things concerning the starred/unstarred elements:  1) it removes the column with the picture of a star in the list of messages;  2) it removes the 'starred' line in the menu;  3) it removes the star at the top of the message when reading the whole message;  4) it removes the 'starred' and 'unstarred' selectors.The style is customizable; read carefully below.Two method are provided forremoving the column. The method 1 (default) allows you to set the exact empty width you want to keep between the checkbox and the author of the message. Just edit the style and look for some "width: 4px" text under the "Method 1" section and put there the exact value you want. The method 2 removes the column and leaves no horizontal space. If you are interested by the second method, you must comment the first method and uncomment the second one.Warning: it is not possible with stylish to remove ONLY the two last comas in the line of selectors. Removing two selectors and leaving the comas would be ugly. For that reason, the style hides all the comas. If you don't like that, you may want to keep the whole line. Just edit the style and comment the last section of the style.You may use this style with the following one:style 7876for removing the whole line of selectors.`
