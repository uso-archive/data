@namespace    USO Archive
@author       xgraphy
@description  This simple style removes the suggestions, events etc. right panel on the homepage and makes the feed wider to make use of this new space.  It also makes the feed on profiles wider.    A good plug-in for people who hate facebook suggesting you add someone because they attend the same uni as you!    Sorry about the screenshot blurs, I have to protect the innocent!    UPDATED!!! To match the new facebook layout that was applied 5thFeb2010.
