@name           LibraryThing - Touchstones Link Fix
@namespace      USO Archive
@author         jtgorman
@description    `This is a very quick and crude fix so that when a "Touchstone" is clicked on, the old menu that used to appear will show. Word of warning, it'll show two links under the touchstone after you click it.  Highlight doesn't seem to work.  I might try to combine this styleshee tweak with a Greasemonkey script to provide a more useful set of choices. Painful details:So say you have the following touchstones in a list:Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle by Betty MacDonaldThe Elephant Man by Bernard PomeranceEast of Eden by John SteinbeckAnna Karenina by Leo TolstoyClicking on Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle by Betty MacDonaldwill cause two links to appear below the title/author.Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle by Betty MacDonaldhighlight | work info`
