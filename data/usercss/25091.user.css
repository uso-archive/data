@name         LibraryThing - Touchstones Link Fix
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       jtgorman
@description  This is a very quick and crude fix so that when a "Touchstone" is clicked on, the old menu that used to appear will show. Word of warning, it'll show two links under the touchstone after you click it.  Highlight doesn't seem to work.  I might try to combine this styleshee tweak with a Greasemonkey script to provide a more useful set of choices.         Painful details:    So say you have the following touchstones in a list:    Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle by Betty MacDonald  The Elephant Man by Bernard Pomerance  East of Eden by John Steinbeck  Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy    Clicking on   Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle by Betty MacDonald    will cause two links to appear below the title/author.
