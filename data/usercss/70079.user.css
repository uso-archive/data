@description  My facebook addiction made my workday very inefficient and I think that it is a waste of time in 2012 anyway. Unfortunately we are dependend on it to communicate via the messaging system. It became sort of a standard in our life. To concentrate on one task which is the messaging, I worked out how to hide everything distracting. Yes really ONLY MESSAGING. No more random shouts, pictures etc from your "friends" which are not real friends.. The philosophy is "if you cannot see it, you will not click on it and not waste time". An imo already faces of friends are a distraction in you workplace. Quick tutorial what to do to make facebook "messaging system only". Read additional info as characters are limited in this field to 1000.. -.-        Good luck!
