@description    `The Chromium developers decided to make in-browser underlines (links, for example) skip descenders and other marks underneath the baseline by default.  Unfortunately, they didn't include a setting for the user to override it, and the browsers that use Chromium didn't either (as of January 2018).If you don't want it, the best you can do is override that setting for all sites, even those that may be using it on purpose.  This user style does that for you.`
