@description  Tumblr logo in Harry Potter font. Black and maroon colors.   I made this to go with this background: http://tinyurl.com/3hz4mom because I didn't really like the logo it came with...so yea. The before picture is the logo that the said background came with. The after is my logo. So, please enjoy :)  http://aripotta.tumblr.com/    UPDATE (8/23/13): I see now that tinypic has deleted my picture. I don't know why exactly. The computer I created this logo on crashed some time ago and I do not have the ability to upload it again. I will, however, try to recreate it. No ETA available, but know that I have every intention on uploading it as quickly as possible. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, cheryy-lipz.    If you like this logo, please keep checking the description every other day or so to find out if it's up. I'm really sorry about this. Thank you for your understanding.
