@description  Compresses the spacing between your toolbars for improved screen space.  Works on Firefox 2 and Firefox 3.     Features:  - Shortens the Vertical length between the Bookmarks Toolbar and the Navigation Toolbar  - Compacts Padding between the Bookmarks Toolbar and the Tab Bar.  Removes the Horizontal toolbar separator  - An excellent GUI Improvement for anyone using low screen resolutions, or those who want more webpage content displayed.    You can notice the difference when the style is loaded, and from the screenshot, you can see that many pixels are saved.    Works on Versions:  - Firefox2  - Firefox3    Integrates with Styles:  - Style 7706  - Style 7703      About:Screenshot:  I am already using a compacted theme, so those using other themes (or the default theme) could most likely see a reduction of 10 pixels or more.  Though, a 3 pixel increase is still great!    Changelog:  - Initial Release
