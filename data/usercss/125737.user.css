@description  Show BookMark bar only on new tab page. Also this style show bookmark bar on "about:..." and "chrome:..." pages for compatibility.  You should open bookmark bar panel for working this CSS style!    Know issue:    1. Some Stylish's or Firefox's bug.  Sometimes, somehow bookmark bar may become "grey" (bookmarks are not deleted!). Elements will be just hiding. You should open panel customization (see panel context menu) and try to drug bookmark bar elements.  Also you may try to: restart Firefox, use only English alphabet, turn on/off style.  In my case this bug disappeared. I don't know why.    2. If you open tab with site into detached browser window, bookmarks (NOT bookmark bar!) may be hidden in new window bookmark bar.    Fix issue 2:  You can set one value on about:config page:  browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction in 0  Then restart Firefox.  It for opening all new detached WINDOWS (and popups) ONLY IN new TABS.
