@name         Steam Powered User Forums Bold Fix
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       AbJ32
@description  This style is for users who currently enjoy everything about the new forum theme, aside from the pesky bold. It's a simple fix, and will only affect text without the [b][/b] tags. Text that is supposed to be bold, and has the [b][/b] tags will still be bold.
