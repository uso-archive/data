@description  Make each page you go to have blue text! If you want to make a style that changes the color of the text, type in * {color: color !important} in the CSS box and replace blue with the color you want (you can only choose red, orange, yellow, green, blue, magenta, and purple). For example, if you want text to be red, type in * {color: red !important} in the CSS box
