@description    `Facebook is utterly shit. Face it. Let's call it Shitbook. Sadly some people insist upon using Shitbook, which means we must log-in to the SHIT to message them.This user-style will <b><u>HIDE ALL</u> of the posts</b> <u>in the Facebook (Shitbook) news feed</u>. <i>The collective <b>timeline</b> (best of and most recent posts regarding friends or people you follow) is <b>hidden</b>.</i> This allows you to use the chat/message function without being distracted by all the shit people post to the news-feed timeline.Instead of posts in the news feed you just see a blank space. Lovely! Fuck off Mark Zuckerberg, I hate you!I have no idea if people will like or use this style, but here is it nevertheless.Crippled Shitbook functionality, via this style, will remind you to either not log-in or log-out sooner rather than later.`
