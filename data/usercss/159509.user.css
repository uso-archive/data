@description    `FIREFOX ONLY. Automatically switches IME between on and off state, based on which question type you encounter. So you no longer need to keep manually toggling between English and Japanese. Just make sure to keep your language and keyboard set to your Japanese IME when using this userstyle. ^^`

Name:        Duolingo Auto IME On-Off
Author:      mog86uk (aka. testmoogle)
For:         https://www.duolingo.com - Japanese from English course & English from Japanese course (lessons, skill strengthen, global practice, placement test, section test out, & crown test out).
Description: Automatically switches IME between on (Japanese) and off (English) state, based on which question type is encountered on Duolingo.

IMPORTANT: 
  - Only use this userstyle in FIREFOX! (Any version of it is fine.)
  - Make sure you keep your keyboard on Japanese IME at all times. Don't manually switch to another keyboard/language (i.e. English)!
  - Depending on your setup, you may also need to switch to hiragana output at the start too.　Shouldn't be set to half-width alphanumeric.
  - I've only tested this for Microsoft Japanese IME and Google Japanese Input (both in Windows 10).
  - FIREFOX is the only major web browser which currently supports the CSS3 "ime-mode" property needed for this userstyle to work.
