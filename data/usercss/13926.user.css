@name         Songbird - Metadata Editor - Remove Cancel Button
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       dotter
@description  Only displays the "OK" button when you make a change to Metadata Editor.    The order Footer buttons are backwards... this style fixes the problem by hiding the Cancel button.    You can easily just click [X], or escape on your keyboard, and this is a bug with the editor...   Default buttons are OKAY CANCEL, but Songbird uses CANCEL OK, which really makes it hard to save the track details.
