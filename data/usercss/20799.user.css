@name           extbook - autohide bookmark stars

@description    `Autohide the additional stars of add-on "extbook" (https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/10567) and recover by hovering the urlbar. I think that if you set up the stars once, you don't usually need to show the addstar-button, so I hide it. If you want it back, just comment out the appropriate lines.There is one bug in my code: If you click the "old" star to edit your bookmark, the dialog window jumps somewhere. I don't know how to fix it. But if you use the library to edit, you shouldn't worry.Hey, and watch my nice APNG-image ;-)If you don't want the feed-button to jump around, add "#feed-button {-moz-box-ordinal-group: 2 !important;}". Have a look at style 20983 by me.`
