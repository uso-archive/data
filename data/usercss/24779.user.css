@description  My first style so be gentle.  This should work with most other 4chan and several other sites with some minor tweaks.  If you use this to make another style or for another theme, let me know! I am always looking for new styles to use myself!  Next up is facebook. Shouldn't be hard now.    YOU NEED A GLASSER FOR FIREFOX FOR THIS TO WORK.  Of course, you should know that.    Any questions? Comments? Let me know.
