@name         Mozilla Addons - limit description sizes (Updated)

@description  If you find this useful in any way, please do the "donate through Paypal" thing. Every little bit helps!    While long descriptions about each add-on you're interested in is awesome, when you're not interested... they're a pain.    This sets each add-on's description to a maximum height, and if it's longer than the max a scroll bar is created.    Inspired by the "Forums - Limit Post Sizes" style.    On parts of the Mozilla Add-ons site, they've redone the layout (Thanks for pointing this out Valacar). I could have separated the two styles, but this is the shorter way.
