@description  This hides the Games your friends are playing panel on FB.  You can add the code to your themes or activate this.  It will leave a small empty cell, if you toggle it on and off, you will see where it was.  I do not believe it affects anything else.  Minimally tested.  Added "Happening Now" hidden.    **Update**  --Hides yet another alt "Trending Now"  :|  --Hides another alternate "Trending Now" box.  --Hides alternate "Trending Now"  --Hides "Trending" in Sidebar  --Hides "Trending Now"  --Hides (ok, I forget what ego_column is, but I hid it)    **Update**  Attempted to hide several newer FB ad stories in the News Feed, however, FB was outputting too many alternatives, I had to switch to FBPurity.com 's fluff buster to eliminate these, as adblock wasn't removing them either.
