@description    `This hides the Games your friends are playing panel on FB.  You can add the code to your themes or activate this.  It will leave a small empty cell, if you toggle it on and off, you will see where it was.  I do not believe it affects anything else.  Minimally tested.  Added "Happening Now" hidden.**Update**--Hides yet another alt "Trending Now"  :|--Hides another alternate "Trending Now" box.--Hides alternate "Trending Now"--Hides "Trending" in Sidebar--Hides "Trending Now"--Hides (ok, I forget what ego_column is, but I hid it)**Update**Attempted to hide several newer FB ad stories in the News Feed, however, FB was outputting too many alternatives, I had to switch to FBPurity.com 's fluff buster to eliminate these, as adblock wasn't removing them either.`
