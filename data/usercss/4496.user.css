@description    `Main section font is too small (for me, at least).  I made it bigger.I'm not sure where they messed it up, most of the CSS on the page correctly uses relative sizes, and the only absolute sizes I could find were for things like links and menus...All you really need is that first line (.primaryMainColumn) ... the other part may mess render the side column on top of text on your system.Finer details:  I'm on X11 with the default serif font set to size 12.  I like text on the smaller side, but this site's ~6pt was too small.`
