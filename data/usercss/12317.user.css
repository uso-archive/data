@description    `iFox Original, iFox Metal, iFox Smooth and iFox Graphite all suffer from a fault displaying buttons in multi line dialog boxes, giving the buttons a chopped off look.  This simple code fixes this annoying problem throughout these themes.  It may also fix similar problems in other iFox themes.  I'll have to check.`
