@name         Tumblr - 3D Text
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       persephone
@description  <p><b>**this is no longer going to be updated**</b></p>  This code makes the text on the Tumblr dashboard look 3D. It also changes the font to 'Raleway' instead.  This works best with a dash theme with a dark post background, such as <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/106629/tumblr-nighttime-bakathemes">this one</a>.    Please leave feedback!
