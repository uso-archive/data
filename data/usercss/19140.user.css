@name           TeamXbox forum: View high-res images easily
@namespace      USO Archive

@description    `Trying to view high-resolution images posted on forum.teamxbox.com is a pain. Install this to view them easily.Oversized images that needed a scrollbar will be scaled to fit the forum post width. Mouse-over images to view them full-size. If viewing a single post (click #postcount in the top right of a post), images will be their original size without needing to hover over them. The only limitation now is your resolution, not the forum width (552px). If you still need to scroll, use the arrow keys or 'right-click > View Image'.Screenshots: before, after, hover, view Single Post: http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/2143/changesn.jpgTry style 20126 if you want the forums to be wider overall.`
