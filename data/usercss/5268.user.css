@description  Uses the Night Launch theme's background image on macgyver.com    I had just installed the firefox Night Launch theme and noticed the wicked cool background.  i would have wanted it as my homepage, but i was already using http://www.macgyver.com/    so, naturally, its better when you have both.      keep in mind that i know *basically nothing* about CSS, so if you find some bug or know an improvement,  why not share?
