@description    `Uses the Night Launch theme's background image on macgyver.comI had just installed the firefox Night Launch theme and noticed the wicked cool background.i would have wanted it as my homepage, but i was already using http://www.macgyver.com/so, naturally, its better when you have both.keep in mind that i know *basically nothing* about CSS, so if you find some bug or know an improvement,why not share?`
