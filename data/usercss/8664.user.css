@description  Removes the Site Identity Button if the site does not supply any security information.    Greatly increases web awareness and security.    Features:  + Web site security button will show up for sites that HAVE security information (HTTPS, or sites that have special certificates, cookies, or browser hijacks)  + No button will display on sites that do NOT have security information    Examples of Functionality:  - A site such as Google (when not logged in) has No Security Information (No Site Identity Button will NOT display)  - A site such as Addons.Mozilla.Org HAS security information (The Site Identity button WILL display)    The Site Identity Button icon displays the Favicon of the current site, and when clicked, it brings up Firefox's new Passport Information.  This gives you advanced information about a website, and if any security breaches are occuring.    Increases computer security, by only showing the site identity when it can help you.  Alerts you when a site is secure, or a hijack.    Integrates with Style 8661.  ** Not to be used in conjunction with Style 8026 **    Additional Information:  This style works only on the new Firefox 3 browser.    Changelog:  - Initial Release
