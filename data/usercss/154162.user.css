@description    `<p>Makes your Google Calendar invitations become an embodiment of this philosophy: <a href="https://sivers.org/hellyeah">https://sivers.org/hellyeah</a></p><blockquote><p>Use this rule if you’re often over-committed or too scattered.</p><p>If you’re not saying “HELL YEAH!” about something, say “no”.</p><p>When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!” — then say “no.”</p><p>When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to really throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say “HELL YEAH!”</p><p>Every event you get invited to. Every request to start a new project. If you’re not saying “HELL YEAH!” about it, say “no.”</p><p>We’re all busy. We’ve all taken on too much. Saying yes to less is the way out.</p></blockquote>`
