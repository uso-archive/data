@name           imagevenue.com - Remove useless overlays
@namespace      USO Archive

@description    `Everytime i open an image hosted at imagevenue.com the image is overlayed with an information that i need to accept the TOS. Maybe it’s a bug, or the fact, that i do not save any cookies. Whatever it is, it is annoying, so i decided to create an user style, that removes the overlay.Another useless overlay is the one showing an ad from   s t r e a m m a t e .  c o m   that is annoying, too.This user style removes them both.Edit 2010-02-22: The new donate for Haiti overlay got removed now, too. (I guess that i see it all the time is because i’m ot accepting cookies from ImageVenue)`
