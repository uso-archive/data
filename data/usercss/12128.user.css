@description    `Wikipedia : Delete the languages you don't understand anyway.If you're like me, you only know four languages, so the others in wikipedia's list are useless to you.This stylesheet Fades them. It is based on style 4152, which really removes them instead of making them lighter.(Which you might want instead, or you can even combine them, delete most languages, fade out some, but show your mother tongue)`
