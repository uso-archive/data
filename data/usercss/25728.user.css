@description  Expand your farm 2. Bigger's better, right? :-)  You HAVE TO install this style style 25727 in order for this to work.    Work with both Firefox's Stylish and Chrome's Chrome Stylish http://ss-o.net/chrome_extension/    Attention: If the game screen is too big, it might slow your browser down. So if you want the game to run smoother, you should edit the style and change BOTH of the rows:  width:1200px;  to  width:1100px;  or  width:1000px;  or whatever it suits your computer's power.    You might want to install this style: style 25724
