@description  There are several Gmail no logo print scripts but one of the main issues is that the URL targeting is too broad and affects other areas of Google websites.  This version only has 1 CSS entry and relies on regex for just the printing page for Gmail (relied on example from sunaku's https://userstyles.org/styles/105481/gmail-monospaced-printing)
