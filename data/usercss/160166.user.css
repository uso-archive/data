@description  Use dragon scries in the dressing room, complete with skins/accents! You can find skin/accent URLs in the FR item DB -> https://items.kanojo.de/    INSTRUCTIONS: After installing, you need to edit the style in order to add your scry and accent URLs. In Chrome this can be done by clicking the pencil under the style's name in the Stylish dropdown.

/*

- From the dressing room, select the mannequin of the scry's breed and gender and apply an invisibility cloak to get clothing to show up correctly.

- If you want to remove a skin/accent or scry without replacing it with a different one, you can replace the url with random text or a transparent image (ex: 'none' or 'http://flightrising.com/images/layout/trans.png') when you want to stop dressing scries, either replace all URLS with none/transparent or disable the addon.

- You can find skin/accent URLs on items.kanojo.de.

- If the scry isn't showing up properly, make sure you've hit Save and that the Enabled tickbox is still checked (if you hit Edit while it's disabled, it can be a bit finnicky and un-enable when you save.)
