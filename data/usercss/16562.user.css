@description  This is meant to fix the problem of having two scroll bars within a window on the www.digikey.com Supplier Portals.  There is great annoyance of having to scroll twice to see information that can easily be navigated in a single window.  This eliminates the small framed windows that limit the amount of information you can see at one time.
