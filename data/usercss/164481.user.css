@name         YouTube: reduce clickbaitiness
@namespace    USO Archive

@description  userstyles.org crops the screenshot and there is no good way around this. <a href="https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/164481_after.png">Uncropped version</a>    Removes all views, likes, and subscription numbers from Youtube for a cleaner experience without pre-judgements.      "I don't think there's any disagreement that Netflix would be worse if they had view numbers next to all of the shows, it causes you to prejudge... [With Youtube] you can't come to it just as a thing to be consumed and taken on its own" - CGP Grey, Hello Internet Podcast #109    Inspired by CGP Grey & Brady Haran of Hello Internet podcast.
