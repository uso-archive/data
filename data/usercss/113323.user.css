@description    `FiMFiction.net admins added a system for site announcements that don't wait until you check your feed.Given that the "and stay gone" part of the dismiss link seems to be very buggy, they interact poorly with middle-clicking, and I've only ever seen them used for test messages and "please take a user survey" popups so far, they seem more annoying than useful... so here's a script to hide them.`
