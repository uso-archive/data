@description    `blanks out conversations.the original post is preserved (at least, its first paragraph) and the names of people replying are preserved (you'll see that a conversation has happened, but not the replies themselves). Fresh replies (from people you follow) will still appear. You can still view the full conversation by going to the person's blog, but they won't show on your dash.`
