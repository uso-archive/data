@description  Less cluttered home page of Polish news portal, Gazeta.pl  I just removed boxes which I don't ever use...  Enjoy!    v0.4: 2009-08-14: removing loads of new crap.  v0.3: 2008-10-17: new crap "Technologie" was recently added, the level of writing there is so bad that i decided to remove it.  v0.2: 2008-04-24: gazeta.pl added some more crap to the site, so minor update was necessary.  v0.1: (?) document created  PS. Please note that this is just for the main page of the portal, and this is made just for my preference. Feel free to cutomize it to your needs.
