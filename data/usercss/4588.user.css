@description  If someone's twitt is wider than recent updates table it shouldn't spoil layout anymore.    PS: Btw, I don't know how user 2695 can claim it's his style (style 3216). It's also interesting because I wrote this userCSS after my friend ( http://twitter.com/pusewicz/statuses/217686202 ) spoiled twitter's layout - on the 21st of August and I posted it online - creation date of that copycat CSS.
