@description  I got tired of Amazon's bloat - it takes forever to load, and there is just too much stuff on the screen. I tried to reduce the clutter ( style 4328 ), but that doesn't help the load time.    Then I discovered Amazon has a mobile site (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw), which is virtually text-only (small icons and cover pics), and lightning-quick. Works well in a sidebar, too.    I felt that it could use space a little more efficiently though. And removed a couple of categories I'm never going to use.
