@description  Removes most of the ads, the one in the sidebar (main page only) stays.  This was simply because it's a non intrusive ad.    I'm thinking of adding some other tweaks (left aligning the user info in topics etc.)  Requests for features here: http://thevistaforums.com/index.php?/user/212-crank/ (PM me)    Features:  - Removes top ientry bar  - Removes header ad  - Removes right ad    (not on the main page as explained above)  - Removes spacing    (when using Adblock the ads are gone but the "ad-space" stays empty, this removes the empty space)  - And one hidden feature that nobody at all is going to find! :P    Known Bugs:  - Hidden feature causes the TVF on the Web box to disappear when active.    (considered not important enough to fix)      Changelog:  - 0.8.23: trimmed the code, smaller filesize, easier to use the hidden feature

* There seems to be a lot of useless code in this, some of it is, not all imgs have to be resized, some have to.
* For those of you actually looking at this, there's a small tweak down below, check the commented lines ;)
