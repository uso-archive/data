@description  Starfleet Commander style to change friendly alliance background, if you have trouble telling friendlies from other normal users this script will change the background of the Friendly NAP members and people on your buddy list to a green color which will make them readily identifiable.  Because this affects the other user background colors, I also had to make adjustments to the background color of your own planets and enemy alliances you are at war with but they are close to what they are originally. For some reason I can't explain removing the background image on the friendly planets and changing it to a new color background also changed the color of your planets to the same background color as the friendlies so then I had to fix that.
