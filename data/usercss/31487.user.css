@name         D&DI Compendium - Raised Thingum
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Ron A.
@description  This one centers Compendium stat blocks that have been loaded into new tabs, and surrounds them with a gray outset line while changing that page's background color to silver. It looks like a raised thingum in a dungeon, get it? WHOA -- it's like you're RIGHT there, IN a dungeon, NEAR a thingum...    :-o    6/29 - Minor update: I think the stat blocks look better with the Georgia font (as in the preview pics below), so in it goes. Delete the font line if you want the standard look.    :-o
