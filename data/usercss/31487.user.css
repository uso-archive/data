@description    `This one centers Compendium stat blocks that have been loaded into new tabs, and surrounds them with a gray outset line while changing that page's background color to silver. It looks like a raised thingum in a dungeon, get it? WHOA -- it's like you're RIGHT there, IN a dungeon, NEAR a thingum...:-o6/29 - Minor update: I think the stat blocks look better with the Georgia font (as in the preview pics below), so in it goes. Delete the font line if you want the standard look.:-o`
