@description    `Twitter is a great service and has highlighted topics in the Twittersphere with its Election 08 toolbar. The problem is that they give it to everyone and its behaviour is erratic -- you can close it, but you can't predict when it will open again.This user style should remove the Election 08 toolbar when it is in its expanded and its collapsed states.`
