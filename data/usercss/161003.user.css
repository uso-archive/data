@description  YouTube End Cards are a YouTube Feature that shows the next Video that the owner defined, that sometimes cover the whole Video at the End, so you cant see the Rest.    This little CSS Code is going to make them Transparent, If you wanna See the End Cards again you just need to hover on them and they are showing up again.
