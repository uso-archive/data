@description    `Basically, this removes the translucent background image that exists on Garry's blog (garry.tv). This isn't much, but it is something that annoys me, and I wouldn't be surprised if it annoyed anyone else.Overall, this makes the layout look cleaner and the text more readable. The color used on the background color is default for the Wordpress theme.`
