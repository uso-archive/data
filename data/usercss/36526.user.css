@name         Garry's Blog -- No Background Opacity
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       deadeye536
@description  Basically, this removes the translucent background image that exists on Garry's blog (garry.tv). This isn't much, but it is something that annoys me, and I wouldn't be surprised if it annoyed anyone else.    Overall, this makes the layout look cleaner and the text more readable. The color used on the background color is default for the Wordpress theme.
