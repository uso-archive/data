@name         Fallen London - No Ability Improv on Faction Cards
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Corran
@description  After a weekly visit to the Cave of the Nadir I sometimes clicked the ability improvement options on the Faction cards by mistake, wasting Favours. This style removes those buttons and nothing else.    This style works with the June 2018 redesign.
