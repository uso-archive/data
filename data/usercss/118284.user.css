@description  i don't like their "HeartBeat" system , specialy how it appear suddently without explanation.    I use their  reporting and telemetry functionality.  I think is more useful than this marketing stuff..      And since their last updated versions , Firefox became more or less like an "Google Chrome",   without it take care our advise and let us to choose how to customize it.    By example, Read here :  <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/08/21/the-future-of-developing-firefox-add-ons/">The Future of Developing Firefox Add-ons</a>
