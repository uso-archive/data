@description  This one centers Compendium stat blocks that have been loaded into a new tabs and surrounds them with a dashed line. (I like to use the Windows Snipping Tool to save creature and item blocks as images so I can quickly reference them during my games; this style helps speed up the process a bit.)    6/29 - Minor update: I think the stat blocks look better with the Georgia font (as in the preview pics below), so in it goes. Delete the font line if you want the standard look.
