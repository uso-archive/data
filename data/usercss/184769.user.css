@description  Blocking the Adblocker Blocker on Forbes.  Forcing options is not the way to do it, So i create a third option.    Yes i also know and understand there are addons for this however, some sites are unprotected and use plain CSS which is easy to bypass. Also a lot of those addons dont work and only ever get update like once every two months.
