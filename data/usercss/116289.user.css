@name         Tumblr Dash: New Tab Reblog Fix
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Tiberius
@description  For some unknown reason, tumblr has started using double the glass effect on reblog forms when opened in a new tab, which was leaving the dashboard underneath useless and still blacked out (or blued out, whatever) after the form disappeared; basically, this fixes that.
