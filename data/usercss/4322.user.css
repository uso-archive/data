@name         moodle.dcu.ie: Override a.hover
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       bmcm
@description  Current site default is to embolden links on hover. This causes transient re-layout, potentially on a large scale (as the emboldened link text is wider than than normal text). This, in turn, is distracting and irritating (to me!). This style does its best to override that.  It also (added bonus?) underlines all links by default, restores the classic distinction between visited and unvisited links, and makes the default text color black (rather than a washed out grey that I find hard to read!).

/* The following attempts to fixup an irritating tendancy for moodle.dcu.ie
   to embolden links on hover (irritating because it generally causes transient, large
   scale layout changes, at least for the current paragraph if not the whole
   page). However, this is a little tricky, because what one really wants to
   say is something like "ignore a:hover" styling, but that isn't (?) expressible
   in CSS. Instead we have to specify some particular alternative styling;
   and that's problematic because we can't be sure what the "non-hover" styling
   already was.  So the rules below are a compromise - they start by saying that,
   on hover, just leave font-weight: normal; but if we are inside .navbar or
   strong, then it should indeed be bold (as it presumably already was). This
   does not cover all cases by any means (e.g., if someone uses 
   style="font-weight: bold" we really have no way of adequately dealing with that!).
