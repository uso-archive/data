@name         Fallen London - Remove Specific Go Buttons
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Corran
@description  This removes the Go button from a number of cards so there's no risk to click the button by mistake. This is mostly for options you really don't normally want to take. You can disable this style temporarily to enable the button. You can also edit the css directly if you want a button to appear permanently; the comments in the css show exactly which button is on what line.    This style works with the June 2018 redesign.
