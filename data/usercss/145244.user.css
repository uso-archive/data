@description  Knocking out YouTube SIDEBAR ads.  Currently, this just removes the ads that started to show on the side list of videos.     In the picture, it has a yellow box around it.  Not shown in this picture is  a small "i" inside a white dot at the upper right corner for info on Google ads (I cropped the picture too narrow).  This is the ad that gets removed.
