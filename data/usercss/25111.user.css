@name         Google Buzz Custom Theme Text Fix
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       crosmanrond
@description  A temporary fix for the Google Buzz bug in which text colors follow the theme colors selectively and therefore are hard or impossible to read.  This style will set the text to black by default(leaving the background white) but could conceivable turn the background any other color too(with some work).    Note: I heard from a Google Employee that this should be resolved soon, but for those of us who can't wait...
