@name         37 Signals Basecamp â€” Improved redability & space
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Stash
@description  Improved readability by widening the usable space for the lists, pushing the side panel over to be inline with the right-hand tabs and making the code font in Writeboard Consolas with less vertical spacing.    Make sure you have http://userstyles.org/styles/12373 installed to properly see the differences in the screenshots below!
