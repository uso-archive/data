@description  With this style, Flickr will highlight the links that you have already visited.    This style improves page navigation and element focus, for Flickr, which does not display the pages you have already visited in a separate color.  This makes Flickr a lot more usable, so you do not go to pages you have already been to (visual history).    * Based upon user 6147's style 5351    Features:  + Purple href hover highlight text (customizable)  + More Noticeable  + Works on all links (a href)    Works on both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3    Integrates with Styles:  + Style 11529  + Style 8772    Changelog:  1.0.0.2:  + Removed Link coloring on Flickr's Footer navigation areas.  Now main content area is the only highlighted link area.    1.0.0.1:  + Removed Link coloring on Flickr's Navigation header menus.  Now Flickr will only color links below the header.
