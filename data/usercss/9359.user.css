@description  Makes the Search Bar and all AutoComplete lists see-thru (transparent).    AutoComplete Popups are the lists of text that contain searches or information that you had entered previously, such as a previous Google search, or an email address box on a Forum.    * Thanks to user 6431 for introducing me into the realm of Transparency with style 6771    Features:  + Background of the popup list will be invisible (see through - transparent)    Applies to:  + Autocomplete  + Forms  + Firefox Search Bar (SearchBar)  + Web Search TextBoxes  + Website Username Fields  + Inquisitor, google, yahoo, answers, amazon, creative commons, wikipedia, and ebay (among many more!)   + ...    Browser Versions:  + Works only on Firefox 3      Integrates with the following Styles:  + Style 8528  + Style 8527    * When this style is installed, you may not be able to see the selector (up down blue highlight), I am currently working on a fix for this bug. *    Changelog:  1.0.0.1  + Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.
