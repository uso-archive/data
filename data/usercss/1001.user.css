@description  It's a little trick to hide the search-go-button in the search bar, which increase the space for the search box.    Note: thanks to  Paulfox for the add to the code in the comments.  Ok, i didnt know that it was enough with one line:  #searchbar .search-go-button-stack {display: none !important;}    Greetings Paulfox, i used many of yr userstyles.    I add plus to hide the GO button just besides the search-engine-button (for the people who dont used it)    MozNation please go away to lie in some other place, here liars like you are not welcome.
