@description  For Firefox 4+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds.    This hides only the Hovered Link Target URLs from showing at bottom of screen without disturbing the connection status messages, so the Connection Status Display popup flickering won't be so annoying. Due to (bug 541656 - Display hyperlink URLs at bottom of window (instead of right side of location bar))    Tested on Firefox 4+ and up to latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.    Credit for code goes to:    User Chris000001 on: http://forums.mozillazine.org/    To customize or fix Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds, you can also have a look at my other styles: user 61655
