@description  Many Windows users of Firefox, including myself, suffer from strange Helvetica font issues. Firefox does not appear to render the font correctly and makes sites which use the font (e.g. Digg, Twitter, etc.) very difficult to read.     This style simply overrides Helvetica Neue and tells Firefox to use the local Arial font instead.    See http://www.keyvan.net/2010/10/helvetica-on-firefox/ for more information.    This problem has been reported in various places:    https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions/750824  https://support.mozilla.com/hi-IN/questions/744520  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578829    ---    Apologies for the deceptive ads you see on this page, I have no control over that.
