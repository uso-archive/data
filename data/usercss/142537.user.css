@description    `who needs this "trendy" category on youtube? aren't you interested in content which you relate to? then you have a right side panel of video references. but trendy? this category offers mostly pranks, disasters, evil reactions and many "seems like" happy young people playing online games. if you are one of the ones that prefer choosing your own taste, you probably don't need trendy category. so you can disable that. ;)`
