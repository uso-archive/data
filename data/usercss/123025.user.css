@name         Bigger PDF Viewer in UBC Connect
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       ubc_css
@description  By default, Connect displays PDFs in a viewer only 400px tall which is far too short for most monitors. This style will make the PDF viewer the same height as the browser window so you can see as much of the page as possible.
