@description    `Analog is a web stats package from the 90s. You'd think no one would use it, but on my web host Dreamhost it's still built in and honestly, it's still very useful for when you don't want to have to grep the logs directly yourself. I made this style because it looks like 1997 still and it's easier to read with a little CSS love. Note that the URL of your Analog output will depend on your host! You'll have to assign this style to your Analog stats manually, the place it affects is for me not for you!That said, I think this CSS will work for any Analog output anywhere, so just use the "Write new style for XYZ.com" button in your Stylish/Stylus browser extension settings and assign this CSS to your Analog page.`
