@description    `Don't you hate how YouTube Player is not centered to a split screen browser window?Well I do!Split screen is available on all major operating system since:<ul>Windows 7+</ul><ul>Apple El Capitan+</ul><ul>Most Linux Desktop Managers (Such as Cinnamon)</ul>Yet when you make a half screen browser window with YouTube running, the YouTube player is right of center!This bothered me so this quickly centers the player when the browser is half screen size!(<strong>Might not work on other resolutions which are not Full HD 1080p</strong>)`
