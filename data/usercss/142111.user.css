@description  Don't you hate how YouTube Player is not centered to a split screen browser window?  Well I do!  Split screen is available on all major operating system since:  <ul>Windows 7+</ul>  <ul>Apple El Capitan+</ul>  <ul>Most Linux Desktop Managers (Such as Cinnamon)</ul>    Yet when you make a half screen browser window with YouTube running, the YouTube player is right of center!  This bothered me so this quickly centers the player when the browser is half screen size!    (<strong>Might not work on other resolutions which are not Full HD 1080p</strong>)
