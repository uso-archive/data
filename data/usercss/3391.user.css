@name         KOL - Tweaks - Resize Trophies

@author       Amanda Kerik
@description  Jick (The creator of Kingdom of Loathing aka KOL) decided to change the number of trophies on a line - from 4 / 5 to 5 / 6. Unless you have a high resolution / change the frame proportions, this is too big for 1024x768 and smaller resolutions.   This style has two related effects - it makes all trophies 1/4 their normal size (they now fit) AND it mocks the e-peen that trophies are by making them smaller.    Updated to work in the relay browser as well.
