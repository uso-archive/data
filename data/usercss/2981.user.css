@name         Drupal-Based Forum Topics: Highlight New Posts
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Wolfey
@description  This style makes the top and bottom borders thick for new posts in Drupal-based forum topics, in order to make it easier to see where any new posts have been made.    [UPDATE: 2007/08/09]  * The top and bottom border style has been changed from solid to dotted, and the left and right border style is now solid.  * Highlighting is no longer applied to a comment being previewed.  * "Before" and "After" screenshots have been added.
