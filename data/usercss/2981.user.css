@description    `This style makes the top and bottom borders thick for new posts in Drupal-based forum topics, in order to make it easier to see where any new posts have been made.[UPDATE: 2007/08/09]* The top and bottom border style has been changed from solid to dotted, and the left and right border style is now solid.* Highlighting is no longer applied to a comment being previewed.* "Before" and "After" screenshots have been added.`
