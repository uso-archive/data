@description    `Are you tired of <b>prying eyes</b> all over your screen at work, in the open space ?Do you want to go on Facebook or your web mail without being spotted by others as the <b>lazy guy</b> ?This css will put all background in 'desert mode'. This will make them think you are on a old-fashioned and boring-to-death and work-related website. You may need to change it to a custom one (grey, white...) to a more corporate one.All images are by default in grey and black and almost transparent. Picture will appear with full opacity  but sill in B&W if your mouse is over them only. This feature reduce the capability of a prying eye to deduce anything in your disadvantage. This feature is also to stop the usual suspicious behaviour (ALt+TAB) of the culprit which is a major hint that you were not working.`
