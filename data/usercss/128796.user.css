@description  This style is for the *NEW* AOL Mail, which AOL recently started pushing on everyone.    Removes the right-side ads and adjusts everything to full width.  Also removes the "fake email" ad at the top of the email list.    One minor inconvenience: it also hides the Settings (gear) button. For those times when you need to access Settings, you can just temporarily disable the style. Or, you can access Settings via the following URL: https://mail.aol.com/d/settings/0
