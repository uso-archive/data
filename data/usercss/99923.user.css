@name         Stalkerbook - Revert Games Feed
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Amanda Kerik
@description  April 2014 a lot of people got hit with an "update" that changed the feed to have HUGE pictures on Games posts and tiny ALL CAPS descriptions that are cut off.    This tweak reverts the posts feed to a more reasonable view.
