@description  Allows you to Customize the menu color of ALL menus.  Increases menu navigation and readability.  Once again, this style supports both Firefox2 and Firefox3.  This is a fun style so you can customize the color to your own Themes or Personas backgrounds.    ** Thanks user 5181 for the similar code of style 5095!!    Functions:  - Text color of the menu will be changed. (Fx3 And Fx2)  - Bolding is optional, and has been commented out of the code, Remove the comments and bold the menus.k    Code Colors Provided:  - Color of menus by default for this theme will be White (easy to change)  - Bold text will be Disabled  - Yes, screenshot shows red, but it looked bad on white (thats why it is Customizable!)    Applies to:  - File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Tools and Help menus  - Navigation Toolbar (example: right clicking on back button)  - Main Context Menu (Right clicking on any web page)  - Right-Clicking on a tab  - Right-Clicking on the Location Bar (address bar)  - Also Applies to EVERY single menu on any window of a popup or pane    Browser Versions:  - Works on Firefox 2  - Works on Firefox 3    Additional Information:  - Make sure you don't use a menu-color that conflicts with your themes.  This is a warning, as this is an almost global UI style, so don't complain in the ratings, just choose a good color!    Integrates with Style 7750    Changelog:  1.0.0.1:  - The Description says that Bold is optional and commented out, but it was not.  I have now commented out the bolding.  * Please make a copy of your custom colors when updating this style, your colors will need to be re-entered.
