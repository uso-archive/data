UPDATE APRIL 20 2013
Synchronized site changes to this style, everything should match up now

UPDATE APRIL 19 2013
Forget it, I'm disabling the tab bar by default now because I found that
the links are availble on the pages elsewhere (dropdown combobox, for example)
so if you REALLY want it back, comment out the header section. My next
target is to do the restyling of the cpanel/siteselection/login
screen  alltogether   Please dont request for me to modify the site like
get rid of the captcha and stuff like that, im not the webmaster, i hate
when people ask me that.. so please. dont. I can only make CSS style changes
and CSS only allows for some html changing, which i feel could be better but
I guess that would be considered hacking the site... now wouldnt it. But
really, i guess if you dont want it restyled at all just make the whole thing
java or something. I have and always will represent freedom of customization
when it comes to color. Many of us hate the white background, thats gonna
be the next thing to change... ok?   Please do request color schemes.

UPDATE APRIL 17 2013
as much as i'd like to get rid of "EARN MONEY" tab on the top-right
tab bar, it is in fact using the old MAP element, which is not CSS at all
and unfortunately cant be manipulated... i could hide it I guess but then
you wouldnt have access to the other links, if you dont care uncomment the
thing anways, its available below under "header"

if cpanel changes the position of the tables, you must change
the numbers, if you dont use adblock you will need to block the
content tables as well -- this css style will do this for you
without the need for adblock at all, but ONLY for this page
you will need adblock for the rest of the site if you want it
I find it annoying when trying to build a site having ads smack
in the middle of my face, if anything it will make me change to
a different free provider who wont (and they ARE out there)

these elements listed below corrospond to these parts (as of 3/23/2013)
but may change position, id, and/or classnames over time (i may
or may not update this in the future hard to say, best thing to do
is update it yourself)

#container>#maincontent>div>p  =  "if you like our serv...ys" paragraph
#container>#maincontent>div>table  =  the link/donate/pay for services links following the above
#sidebar1>p>a>img  = the "Upgrade to Premium Service" picture ad below your account info
body>div>div>table:nth-child(5)  =  the "sponsors" table
body>div>div>table:nth-child(7) = the "get a premium domain name" and "get yourdomain.com for free!" table

note that you can get a yourdomain.tk for free, you dont need to spend money on a domain that is 100% your own
the internet was founded as a free place, theres supposed to be no charge for basic internet services like domain names
and stuff like that, the only cost is supposed to be in actual services that might have costs... even this most the time
can be found free... as you can see, the rich fancy websites pay so that us poor websites can exist without having to...
i encourage you if you have lots of money to support and do your part however!

(im poor to the bone)

this _should_ hide the DDOS attack notice

the DDOS table and the main menu table is the "border=0" tag, other
than that they are identical except that DDOS is NOT a sharedtable
class id, but i felt that it could break things worse if i did it that
way----comment these lines out if you dont want/need DDOS attack info

    Uncomment this if you want it, this will remove the image map and
    all the tabs, and display the logo without the tabs, which is fine if
    you don't use them, otherwise you may want them on. I dont like them
    because they sneak that AD (earn money) inbetween the two tabs, and
    actually theres only two real useful buttons and they are both 
    accessible via other links on the page (like the dropdown button
    combobox) and the "Get Help" button is pretty easy, if you need the
    get help button you probably wont be using this style to begin with
