@name         Google Voice - Hide "Do Not Disturb" Notice
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       WCityMike
@description  I leave Google Voice in "do not disturb" mode all the time, since I do not use it for call screening; once my normal number hands it off to my Google Voice number, I want it to go to voicemail as quickly as possible.  This merely hides the "'do not disturb' is on" notice, since I always expect it to be on and it can be distracting from other messages Google Voice might be displaying in the same area.
