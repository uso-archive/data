@name           Harvest App Timesheet for Narrow-Width Windows
@namespace      USO Archive
@author         Aaron W
@description    `UPDATED!Makes it so the timesheet is more usable for narrow-width windows.  I like to keep my timesheet windows very narrow, so it can be more like a floating little widget I can keep in the corner of my screen. This one is usable (though not necessarily pretty) down to perhaps 150px or so.NOTE: I have also gotten this working for older versions of Firefox, which don't support regex for matching rules.  In that case, you need to manually update the matching rule to something that will match your instance of Harvest.  I have gotten this to work with Midori's built-in "user styles" functionality as well.`

version 0.3 - 2014-03-26
* updated the matching regex to better capture possible permutations of harvest timesheet URLs ... also, please note that on older versions of Firefox, and on other browsers such as midori, this CSS still work, but the regex matching rule doesn't work because those versions don't support regular expressions ... you will have to manually use a domain or a URL matching rule.

version 0.2 - 2013-11-04
* updated to include styling for new entry / edit entry modal popup
* updated URL match to a regex that should work for other people's 
    harvest accounts, not just mine -- assuming that everybody else's
    harvest account starts with "username.harvestapp.com"
