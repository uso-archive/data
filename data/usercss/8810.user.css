@description  Hides the "Compatibility Warning" from showing on the Extensions (Addons) Manager.  The warning reads: "Add-on compatibility checking is disabled.  You may have incompatible add-ons." and shows up when you use Extensions such as Nightly Tester Tools or Mr Tech Toolkit.    Additional Information:  - This style only hides the compatability warning.  All other Extensions List warnings WILL still show up (such as restarting your browser ...)    Browser Versions:  + Works on Firefox3 (Developed specifically for Firefox 3)  + Works on Firefox2    Integrates with Style 7739    Additional Information:  This Style has been tested on multiple Firefox Themes, and has worked perfectly on each.    Changelog:  1.0.0.1:  + Added an Author: row to the style's description... For some reason I forgot to add it.
