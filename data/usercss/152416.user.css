@description    `PlanetRomeo is a gay website and pink is missing, or any rainbow. Its official style does not represent any aspect of gay culture and it feels more like a model-scouting platform. We need to queen it up before it's too late and we all mistake it for a straight club. What could queer people use that has also got a web interface? A web page can be secured and its privacy controlled to a good extent unlike apps. Let's make the only web-enabled gay social-network worth some attention an enjoyable place for everyone. QUEEN IT UP. Pink is manlier than anything else. Or is your willy blue? Go and see a doctor....`
