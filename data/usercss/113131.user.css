@description  Blocks the new third-party ads on FurAffinity. Does not block user-submitted advertising; only blocks Google-served ads. Also collapses ad space, which AdBlock does not do automatically.    *** THIS HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED FOR A LONG TIME AND WILL NO LONGER BE UPDATED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ***
