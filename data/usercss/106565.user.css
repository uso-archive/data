@description  Disabling annoying Font Boosting* on Firefox for Android, so that websites could be viewed properly just like on the desktop browsers.    Side effect: Text Size setting will no longer work.    *Font Boosting is a feature that aim to make mobile reading more comfortable but ended up braking many websites by inconsistently resizing texts on webpages.
