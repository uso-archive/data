@description  For those of us musicians that use a laptop on stage instead of a tablet for tabs/notes while playing worship music, you're going to want this. If your lights team needs to do a black out mode, it'll help prevent you from still being illuminated while on stage. Plus, it'll save your eyes.    I hope it comes in handy! Blessings!
