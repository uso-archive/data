@name         Discord - Minimize/hide Channel + Friends sidebar
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Vinter
@description  This style shrinks the left sidebar (channels and friends) to 12px wide until you hover your cursor over it, which is when it expands to its full width.    A 12px width will allow you to see the white indicator that shows that someone has sent a message in a channel, without taking up too much space.    This style should work for all future versions of Discord, and will also continue being maintained as I depend on it daily myself.    This style AVOIDS minimizing the sidebar in the settings.      ---    Also see my other styles for hiding "Gift nitro", "Send stickers", "Send GIF" and "Send emojis" buttons on the right hand side of the chatting input!
