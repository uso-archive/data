 *  ==UserStyle==
 *  @name        Firefox Add-on Manager - Icons Only
 *  @email       addon_manager_icons_only@thoughtnoise.net
 *  @version     1.0
 *  @description Removes the icon text in the Add-On Manager, leaving only icons.
 *               With only a few types of buttons in the manager, the meaning
 *               of the buttons when using only icons is still easy to
 *               understand. This saves enough screen space that single-line
 *               layouts of the manager are easy. For such an example, I
 *               suggest trying the "Firefox Addons Manager Table Layout"
 *               style by "bernstein" at userstyles.org.
 *                  http://userstyles.org/styles/67076/firefox-addons-manager-table-layout
 *               (Icons Only as originally designed as a suppliment to that style)
