@description  How to replace the original thumbnails with your own images on about:newtab <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5VjCpwQ.png">here is one example</a>    This userstyle is supposed to be used together with my style <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/70561/glassfox-choose-your-personal-newtab">GlassFox - choose your personal NewTab</a>  To simplify it, you can handle all your thumbnails in a separate style. That's the purpose of this userstyle.  Benefits doing that is:   1. easier to manage,   2. protect your thumbnails when your about:newtab-style is updated in the future (otherwise they would have been wiped out ...),    3. your thumbnails can be used together with the original about:newtab page, or an another style (independent my style) if you like.

    background: url("http://wallpaper.address.com/pathway1/pathway2/uniquefilename.jpg") !important; 
    background-size: cover !important;}
    */

/*  Example no. 2, a single address is linked to a single image:   */

    background-size: cover !important;} 
    
    Repeat then the procedure for the next single address + image until you are done.
    
    Regarding how to fit the individual thumbnails: Normally, "background-size: cover" is the best option, but you can replace "cover" with a percentage (e.g. 110%, 100%, 80%, etc).

    [href*="google.com"] .newtab-thumbnail {                                
    background-image: url("https://i.imgsafe.org/0c4e52dc12.png") !important; 
    background-size: 63% !important;} 
    
    /*  Have also a look at the http address in the example above ..... 
    It's of course both easier to manage and faster to load the page if you save all your thumbnails on your computer - 
    i.e. rename and save the Google image "https://i.imgsafe.org/0c4e52dc12.png" to e.g. C:/Firefox/Logo/ =>  url("file://C:/Firefox/Logo/Google_logo.png")   
    
    Due to userstyles.org´s rules I´m not allowed to show it with a local url here, but you can & should save in this way.   */
