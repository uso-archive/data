    background: url("http://wallpaper.address.com/pathway1/pathway2/uniquefilename.jpg") !important; 
    background-size: cover !important;}

    background-size: cover !important;} 
    
    Repeat then the procedure for the next single address + image until you are done.
    
    Regarding how to fit the individual thumbnails: Normally, "background-size: cover" is the best option, but you can replace "cover" with a percentage (e.g. 110%, 100%, 80%, etc).

    [href*="google.com"] .newtab-thumbnail {                                
    background-image: url("https://i.imgsafe.org/0c4e52dc12.png") !important; 
    background-size: 63% !important;} 
    
    /*  Have also a look at the http address in the example above ..... 
    It's of course both easier to manage and faster to load the page if you save all your thumbnails on your computer - 
    i.e. rename and save the Google image "https://i.imgsafe.org/0c4e52dc12.png" to e.g. C:/Firefox/Logo/ =>  url("file://C:/Firefox/Logo/Google_logo.png")   
    
    Due to userstyles.org´s rules I´m not allowed to show it with a local url here, but you can & should save in this way.   */
