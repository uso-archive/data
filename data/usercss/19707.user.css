@description    `This just removes the yellowish banner in G.images...  But does not work well, if at all :( BUT here's a faster fix, no .css innvolved. Just reset Google's filter to "none" - if set @ moderate or strict. Voila! top suggested links & the ugly yellow surround will be gone. It appears that google has "gbv=2" in the url (get by voice) in mod. & strict filters. It works :)   Thanks to those that gave this a try.  (Do not bother with the code below)`
