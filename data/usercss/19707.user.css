@description  This just removes the yellowish banner in G.images...      But does not work well, if at all :(     BUT here's a faster fix, no .css innvolved.     Just reset Google's filter to "none" - if set @ moderate or strict.   Voila! top suggested links & the ugly yellow surround will be gone.   It appears that google has "gbv=2" in the url (get by voice) in mod.   & strict filters. It works :)     Thanks to those that gave this a try.      (Do not bother with the code below)
