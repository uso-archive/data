@name         CppReference: Fix page header element overlapping
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Frank Dana
@description  Recently cppreference.com installed a new search field in the page header, which is being partially overlapped by other page elements due to a bad box-sizing rule in the site CSS. This style simply resets that property back to its default for those elements, correcting the layout issues.
