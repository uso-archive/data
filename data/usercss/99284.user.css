@description    `Most sites, after a link has been visited, change its color from blue to purple. However some colorblind people don't see the difference. This style allows them to change the color to whatever they want, on Reddit and Google.Please use the screenshots to the left and pick whichever style fits you, then select it in the drop-down menu below. "Hanako loves hot chocolate" is the visited link.If you'd like any other site or color added, just email me at atomheartother@gmail.com, I will do my best.`
