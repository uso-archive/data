@description  Removes the Magnifying Glass Search (Go) icon button from the Search Toolbar.  Works for both Firefox 3 and Firefox 2.    ** Thanks to user 552 for supplying this code in the style 1150.  I didn't notice it was there, and created a new style.  Use his style to hide lots more!!    Integrates with Style 7174, and Style 7169, allowing you to remove the RSS Icon, the Bookmark favorite icon, and the Go Button.
