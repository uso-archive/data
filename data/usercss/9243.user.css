@name           Douban - Fixed-width Font (for Programmers)

@description    `By replacing default font-family's on Douban (豆瓣: www.douban.com and www.douban.net) with a Fixed-width Font best for programmers, you can read in a proper manner all articles including source code.This CSS is so simple that you can hack it by yourself into whatever you like with your favorite Fixed-width font on your Mac or Linux computer.  Here I just set to DejaVu Sans Mono and Courier New.In the future I'm *NOT* making it work over the very areas that showing multi-lined text but the whole Douban site.  Whenever you hate it, just turn OFF this style with your Stylish/GreaseMonkey button on the status-bar (if you leave the button there).`
