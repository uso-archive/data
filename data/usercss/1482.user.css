@description  just the good stuff. This is the best tv listing i've found so far once all the junk is removed.    12-04-06 figured out how to block the click-to-hide ad thingy.    12-05-06 edits to reflect nice comment    08-14-07 I don't plan to maintain this anymore as I've been using couchville.com lately - its' nice enough not to need a userstyle!    03-16-08 Couchville is gone :( so I'm back to TitanTV. They just redesigned everything so this is a start at removing the new junk.
