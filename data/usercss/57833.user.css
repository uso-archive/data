@name         Longecity.org - Left Column Removal
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       luminatus
@description  Removes the left column, which is annoying with small displays. Even with 1024 in width, you have to scroll to the right to read the posts.  So even while just being a lurker on the noot' forum, I created this to be able to read more efficiently.  They should have made the column as a separately loaded script instead of being in the main file, then it could be blocked using Adblock Plus... Or just scrap it and use a horizontal menu at the top.
