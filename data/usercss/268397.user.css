@description  Transfer of shares  refers to the intentional transfer of title of the shares between the transferor (one who transfers) and the transferee (one who receives). The shares of a public company are freely transferable unless the company has a valid reason to disallow the same. The shares of a private limited company are not transferable subject to certain exceptions. A transfer deed is executed for the share transfer.    Both <a href="https://www.thegoldenegg.in/services/transfer-of-shares/">share transfer</a> and <a href="https://www.thegoldenegg.in/services/transfer-of-shares/">share transmission</a> involve the movement of ownership in shares. While share transfer involves the voluntary exchange of shares between parties, share transmission typically occurs due to inheritance, death, or court orders, where the shares are transferred to legal heirs or beneficiaries.
