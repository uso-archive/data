@name         New 2011 Runescape redesign - Remove ads and menu
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       hkoivuneva
@description  After Jagex changed their website design, the old ad & menubar removers became out-of-date. This fixes it and should work with all Stylish-supported browsers (and you likely have one).    Instructions:  1. Install Stylish, restart browser.  2. Install this style and set your browser to fullscreen mode.  3. Go to Runescape and open settings:    - Set Screen Sizing to RESIZABLE    - Go to Manual Setup -> Custom -> Max Screen Size = ANY    And you're ready to play fullscreen again ;)    I wish someone could donate ma a dollar for coffee :)
