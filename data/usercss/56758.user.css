@description    `After Jagex changed their website design, the old ad & menubar removers became out-of-date. This fixes it and should work with all Stylish-supported browsers (and you likely have one).Instructions:1. Install Stylish, restart browser.2. Install this style and set your browser to fullscreen mode.3. Go to Runescape and open settings:  - Set Screen Sizing to RESIZABLE  - Go to Manual Setup -> Custom -> Max Screen Size = ANYAnd you're ready to play fullscreen again ;)I wish someone could donate ma a dollar for coffee :)`
