@description    `Another dark skin, this time for popular comic site "Mangayes."  Unlike traditional Dark skins that I make, this one doesn't reskin the ENTIRE site, but instead the background when reading comics.  The front page panes are still bright-ish in colours, because the default colours have a nicer tone to them.  The contract against the black background is very nice, however.`
