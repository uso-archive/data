@description    `Dark-mode compatible, just follow the instructions inside. A way to hide basic scenes, but have other scenes still visible. Should work, let me know if it's super janky. You could use it on your own, but it's generally meant to be used alongside Darkmode, so you can still see scenes, since the maker didn't add that to the latest update.If they want to add this into their style or w/e I'm totally fine with it! I just thought I'd post my fix here because I'm shy and wouldn't want to confront anyone.`
