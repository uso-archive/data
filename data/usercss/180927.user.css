@description  Brings back faster browsing experience by making transitions and animations very fast (0.01 ms) and letting them do the one iteration only. This shouldn't break any website as the animation/transition "happens" and "finishes". It just does that without the common useless, sluggish fancy animations those crazy hipster css designers have made to degrade the browsing experience and heat up the GPUs and spin up the laptop fans for no reason.
