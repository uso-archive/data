@name           Neopets.com - Smaller Font [New Site Design]
@namespace      USO Archive

@description    `If you're like me, you cannot stand the default font family and sizes displayed on the website or the size / font of the buttons and form fields. To me, they're just too large and I prefer a smaller (though still visible) more "organized" look. I was quite annoyed when they enlarged all the drop-down menu's, text field's and button's fonts.This changes the entire site's (including petpages, user lookups, guilds, shops, etc.) to Tahoma 8pt.It can easily be turned on/off, but since this just edits font, it shouldn't be a problem.Click and drag the screenshots to your address bar for a full view.If there's anything I've missed or you feel should be added, let me know. ^^`
