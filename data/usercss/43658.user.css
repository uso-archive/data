@description  I could not stand the weird fixed width layout of Google's Android Market. Specially as when you log in you see trusty old Google Links on top left of page not aligned with rest of Google services. This style changes that and also removes developer-designed pattern from few elements. You are free to copy and improve on this but please drop me a line or keep link to my website here.
