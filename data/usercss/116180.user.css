@description    `Replace "username" with the usernames of people you don't like (in all lowercase), and it will block their messages from your chat. Unlike traditional scripts that let you "ignore" users so their messages are invisible, this script merely covers the entire body of their messages with black bars. This way, you still know they said something, you just don't have to read it, and you can laugh at them for being so silly.`
