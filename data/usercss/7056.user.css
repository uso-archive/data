@name         Vista Media Player Theme for Glasser and Firefox 3
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Recall
@description  Here is a media style FX3 that does not use background images from hosted sites, but rather the latest nightly native code. It looks great with glasser extension which can be found here http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=632112    This will NOT work in XP or any other OS as it does not support glasser. Please do not install or vote if you do not use Vista with Aero + Glasser.    Version 1.05    I also suggest downloading this stylish http://userstyles.org/styles/6588 so that the menu bar gets glass as well :)    This is my first stylish, i really do not know much about css, only what I have read from testing nightlies. So please give feedback and vote to let me know what you think!    Just made a blue version here as well http://userstyles.org/styles/7057    Changelog:    V 1.01 - Updated name to reflect this is for glasser only    V 1.02 - Update, now the findbar is themed.    V 1.03 - Update, fixed findbar text being unreadable, now it is white all the time.    V 1.04 Finally REALLY fixed findbar and text shows up black    V 1.05 Tweaked bookmarks toolbar for better compatibility when having personal menu on bookmarks toolbar. It is now more aesthetically pleasing and better spacing between bookmarks.
