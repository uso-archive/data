@name         YouCenter - Centered Youtube for 1080p screens

@description  A very simple theme that centers youtube on widescreen high def screens (1920x1080p). I'm new to web dev so it's not perfect. Probably breaks on higher resolutions and definitely breaks while zooming in.    Made it because I was very annoyed with the new update at 16/08/2018.
