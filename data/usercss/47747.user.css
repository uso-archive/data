@description  Mozilla Labs have made an addon to do exactly this: https://mozillalabs.com/prospector/2011/05/20/lesschrome-hd-more-space-to-browse/    This userstyle fades in the navbar when reaching the top of the window and fades it out after 5 seconds of no mouseover on the nav-bar.  The special thing about this style is that the nav-bar is shown transparent before the content of the website (see screenshot).    NOTE: This is the first release. Currently the url-bar is set to width of 1200px and the search-bar to 300px! If this does not match your screen, please change these prefs to fit your screen.   If the window is not maximized the url-bar and search-bar may be not full visible!  I will fix it as soon as possible.
