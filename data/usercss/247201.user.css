@name         GGLinnk's Dark Theme for Crates.io (MOVED)
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       GGLinnk
@description  OK, since UserStyles.org have a broken contact form and decided to disallow CSS variables (Or disallow publishing of "invalid" code by a stupid linter) I decided to stop releasing here.  Go see my gist for latest updates : https://gist.github.com/GGLinnk/e67c249a376779a682db271f1728b1d6    This is a mostly finished dark theme for crates.io that totally IGNORE the css name mangle.  Tested on Firefox with Stylus.
