@description  I made this style to go along with style 24339    I would have included this in the Reddit Redux style but it looked odd with some of the greasemonkey scripts that modify Reddit's comment section. I figured it would be better to separate it and give people the option of adding the style to the comments separately.    Full resolution before/after here:http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/9528/commentsnewvold.jpg    Specifics:  - background/border for each individual comment  - mouseover action on the upmod/downmod arrows  - rounded borders    See style 24339 for a full list of features of the Reddit Redux style.
