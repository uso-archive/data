@name         Connection Status Display Timed Delayed - Fx 4+

@description  For Firefox 4+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds.    This delays the connecting, waiting, loading status display messages from showing instantly at bottom of screen and gives it a min-width, so the Connection Status Display popup flickering won't be so noticeable and annoying. Due to (bug 628654 -Show connecting / waiting / loading status messages in small overlay on top of content at bottom of screen)    Tested on Firefox 4+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.
