@description  *   Original Authors:    *     style 3845 by user 4490   *     style 6447 by user 711   *     Some pieces of code (such as labels) from style 5867 by user 6943    To continue the chain of modified styles, I've built on Kemuel's work to include some changes that appeal more to my tastes.     CSS is available from here: http://www.box.net/shared/2yiyfrngg2 as the code is larger than the size constraints imposed by userstyles. That is, don't try to install the CSS included below as it is only a placeholder!    If you like the style, please donate and help me pay my university debt. :)    Notes:    *  I haven't tested the style to include any layouts of gmail except those that I use. In that sense this style is hard-coded. However, feel free to email me at  x o d d e r a   a t   g m a i l . c o m  if you want me to make it more flexible.     *  There are some bits I'd like to change, I'll probably get to those when I get the time.
