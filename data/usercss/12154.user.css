@description    `Watch the video and read the comments at the same time, side by side. Resolution required: 1320x800 or more.Normally, when you scroll through comments, the video gets scrolled up off the screen. This has been intentionally bad design on Youtube's part for years, because they want you to click through related videos that might have ads, instead of engaging in the comments section.This userstyle fixes that: you can now watch the video and read/reply to the text comments at the same time.Author: Dan Dascalescuhttp://dandascalescu.com`

Watch the video and read the comments at the same time, side by side.

Normally, when you scroll through comments, the movie gets scrolled up off the screen. This is bad design on Youtube's part, and this userstyle fixes that: you can now watch the movie and read the text comments at the same time.

Currently, video Responses are not nicely displayed, but you can collapse them. If working on improvements, test at a video with video responses and a "watch in high quality" link, e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-QevraCQUc
