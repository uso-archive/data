@name           OGame Redesign: Ergonomic Ship Selection Buttons
@namespace      USO Archive
@author         Bontchev
@description    `On the first fleet dispatch page of the redesign, the buttons for selection "all ships" or "no ships" are to the far left. The "next" button for moving to the next fleet dispatch page, however, is to the far right. Thus, if the player wants to select the whole fleet stationed at the current moon or planet, s/he will have to walk the mouse across the entire screen - twice, if they have switched to the current planet from the planet selector while on the "fleet movement" page, instead of going through the "Fleet" page.This is very unergonomic and loses precious time that can be the difference between a fleet saved and a fleet crashed during an attack. This script tries to correct this bad design by moving the "all ships" and "no ships" buttons directly above the "next" button, in order to minimize the space that the mouse will have to walk.`
