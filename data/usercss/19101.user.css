@description    `This script allows you to change the visited link color across the Metafilter sites. It was so close to white that after I clicked on a link in a long narrative (especially on AskMe) I had a hard time finding it again. Note: Plutor, of Mefi Greasemonkey script writing fame, wrote this for me. Thanks Plutor!By default the visited link color is changed to a light brown. Edit the script in Stylish and change the HTML code to anything you like.`
