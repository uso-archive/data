@description  I saw style 13056 and i really enjoyed it, but it expands player even when it should be normal size, so i made my own style, which works correctly in such situations.    For those of you, who haven't clicked the link to style 13056 and don't know what both styles do, i'll explain:  It resizes the YouTube player from default 854×505px to 1235×720px, which is much closer to 720p HD (1280×720px)    Imortant Notes:   + I can`t guarantee full compatibility with any userstyle, which doing something with player margins, height and width.   + Youtube expands player even if video is in 480p, it still looks nice, so you dont need to worry 'bout that ;)   + This style works with new layout.   + I`m not going to make big changes in updates, only small fixes.    Thanks for over 9000 of your installs :)    ---    April 26th:   + Fixed VEVO's video pages.
