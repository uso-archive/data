@description    `I saw style 13056 and i really enjoyed it, but it expands player even when it should be normal size, so i made my own style, which works correctly in such situations.For those of you, who haven't clicked the link to style 13056 and don't know what both styles do, i'll explain:It resizes the YouTube player from default 854×505px to 1235×720px, which is much closer to 720p HD (1280×720px)Imortant Notes: + I can`t guarantee full compatibility with any userstyle, which doing something with player margins, height and width. + Youtube expands player even if video is in 480p, it still looks nice, so you dont need to worry 'bout that ;) + This style works with new layout. + I`m not going to make big changes in updates, only small fixes.Thanks for over 9000 of your installs :)---April 26th: + Fixed VEVO's video pages.`
