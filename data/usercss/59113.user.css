@description    `The Tumblr Missing E warning is both annoying and BS. It appears constantly regardless if you've got Missing E installed or not.This just hides the warning. As far as tumblr are concerned you've neither accepted nor declined their offer of 0 support. It technically shows on every page load, you just don't see it.`
