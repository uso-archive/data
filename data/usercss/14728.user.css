@name         APOD; Astronomy Picture of the Day, dark, margins

@description  There are a couple of other dark Astronomy picture of the Day ("style 2426 and 11392")styles but neither addressed the margin issue where the text runs from one side of the screen to the other and I thought their text was too dark and small.      I had written one to give it margins that I had been using, incorporated their idea to give it a black background and remove the boarder around the images. I also made the text easier to read being a shade of white instead of grey.  I used an .em font size instead of a .px size they had used which will size the text to your default. Made the links a little brighter than the text and underlined, change when they are selected, active, or visited. Made bold text slightly bigger and brighter than regular text. Set the default color of text to snow color that wasn't inside some other in-line element such as P or B which the other two neglected (this left some text still black and invisible) by setting the the text color style for body of the page.   Gave some padding around some elements that were a bit too close together in my opinion.      I'm sure if you try this you'll LOVE it and never view APOD again with out it.    (http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/) Astronomy Picture of the Day    The only problem I found is when APOD post really wide images (occasionally) it scrolls off the right side of the screen.  I've tried to fix that problem but until the site is written with better code and the images aren't inside an open P element there isn't anything I can do about that problem.  The APOD site isn't HTML 4.01 compliant, barely 4.0 compliant..
