@description    `This style recolors the autolink tags (See below) to green, to distinguish them from other links.Version 1.4: June 29, 2007 - Remade for koaku site re-redesignVersion 1.2: June 28, 2007 - Remade for kotaku site redesignVersion 1.1: June 20, 2007 - added comment box styleVersion 1.0: June 18, 2007 - Initial styleNote on Autolinks:Gawker Media sites now include links on the first instance of a word which is also a tag for the article.For example, if an article is tagged with the word "dog" the first time the word dog appears in the article it will be a link.That link will merely take you to a page displaying all the articles with that tag.  This feature was already available from the list of tags at the end of the article.The automatic links are confusing whenever there are "real" links on a page.This style fixes the problem by coloring the automatic links green (to somewhat match the kotaku theme) rather than the standard red.`
