@name         GrApple themes – combined tab icon & close button
@namespace    USO Archive

@description  Intended for use with these excellent GrApple themes for Firefox on Mac OS X by Annorax (you can find them at www.takebacktheweb.org):    • GrApple Delicious [Firefox 3]  • GrApple Eos & Eos Pro [Firefox 2]    (Note that GrApple Yummy does not display icons on its tabs, therefore this style is not intended to be used with it.)    Inspired by the tabs in Adium (adiumx.com).    When combined with the GrApple themes listed above, this style hides the tab close buttons by default, showing you only the tab icons. When you hover over a tab, that tab’s icon is hidden, and the close button is displayed in its place. This saves significant tab space without sacrificing any functionality, and works consistently regardless of how congested the tabs become (unlike the default Firefox behavior).    The screenshots below show this style being used in conjunction with GrApple Delicious under OS X Leopard, with the mouse hovering over the rightmost tab.    Enjoy!
