@name         weblio - no distractions

@description  Usually my goal is to eliminate distractions, whether those be ads or click bait for related content regardless of how tenuous that "relationship" might be. I reluctantly hide copyright and other footer blocks because I only ever refer to them when I first start using a site or if I feel the need to provide feedback to the site admin. When that need arises it is easiest to simply disable stylish to gain visibility of whatever I've hidden.

The weblio pages that I primarily use are
 ejje.weblio.jp (意味 & 例文 tabs)
 www.weblio.jp (用語解説, 動画, 本・雑誌, 文献 & 全文検索 tabs)
 thesaurus.weblio.jp (類語辞典 & 対義語・反対語 tabs)
and so these are the specific URLs (and tabs) on which I have tested this custom style.

I use uBlock origin as well as a global css supplied by www.floppymoose.com so it is possible that some advertising that is successfully eliminated by either of those filters is not hidden by this custom style sheet when used on its own. (I did test with those disabled however, ad insertion tactics change so frequently that global filters seem to work better than css.)

As with any user style this one may grow less effective if the target web pages are tweaked by the author. In the (unlikely) event that I stop frequenting the target web site then I am less likely to update the style.

My approach is to use the lowest specificity that satisfies my goal.

To be honest, I get confused trying to construct selectors at higher levels of specificity and I have yet to find a decent tutorial on the subject to cure me of that handicap! And besides, the precedence of user !important rules over author !important rules should make specificity an unnecessary refinement except in those unusual cases where useful content is mixed in with "less-useful" content.
