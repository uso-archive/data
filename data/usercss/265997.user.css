@description  <a href=https://www.thegoldenegg.in/services/transfer-of-shares/>Transfer of shares</a>  refers to the intentional transfer of title of the shares between the transferor (one who transfers) and the transferee (one who receives). The shares of a public company are freely transferable unless the company has a valid reason to disallow the same. The shares of a private limited company are not transferable subject to certain exceptions. A transfer deed is executed for the transfer of shares.    Since brokers provide a service, they also levy fees for the service known as a brokerage that may vary from one broker to another. As a result, it is not uncommon for users to <a href=https://www.thegoldenegg.in/services/transfer-of-shares/>transfer shares from one demat to another</a> as they may feel that the services being offered by another broker are superior or the charges being levied are more economical.
