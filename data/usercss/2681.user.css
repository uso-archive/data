@description  Todoist is a simple and elegant task management tool. Amir Salihefendic seems to work around the clock making it one of the finest applications offered on the web. I designed a heretical logo as a tribute to the tool, and this skin will allow you to display this logo when you use Todoist.  >     http://todoist.com/      Built by John Stephens at http://designop.us/    This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 United States License.
