@description  Returns the banners to FIMFiction.net after knighty removed them recently, to replace then with an unnecessary author tab.  We all care about an aesthetic look of FIMFiction.net and with this tool, you can return the beautiful banners you love.      This userstyle was not made by me, it was created by PiercingSight: http://www.fimfiction.net/user/PiercingSight    Update to adapt to knighty's so-called "FIMFiction 4.0" was made possible by alamais, whose own userscript helped me to find out what I need to change:    https://www.fimfiction.net/user/85763/alamais
