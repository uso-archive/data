@name         Fix YouTube Watched Badges and Progress Bars
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Anthony Martinez
@description  YouTube has recently changed the way they mark videos as "Watched", by adding a red progress bar under the thumbnails of videos you've seen. While it's not terrible in theory, the current execution seems broken. Sometimes the progress bar doesn't get to 100%, even if you do actually watch the whole video. That in turn may prevent the "Watched" badge from showing up, if it even comes up at all anymore. My code sidesteps that mess by adding a "Watched" badge to any watched video, regardless of how much of it you've seen, and it optionally forces the progress bar to be 100%, or hides the progress bar.
