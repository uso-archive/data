@name         Google - Simple background image code
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       there.is.only.xul
@description  <i>I am trying to remain the most current Google style available! I've figured out how to make it more friendly toward the use of dark images, so feel free to use whatever you like. If you still want to check out the other style that came before this, <a href=http://www.userstyles.org/76744>click here</a>.</i>    "Simple" may as well be an overstatement with how complicated the Google pages have become lately.    This style was created to address the issue of Google removing background images for all users. claiming incapability with their new software; Well, we know nothing is impossible with a little extra code, and this, like everything else on userstyles.org stands as a testament to that.    Find any image, then apply the image in the code, replacing the included stock image URL. Have fun with this style, and tweak it to your preferences.    <b>Problems? E-Mail me at bluufoxx.at.gmail/dot/com.  Do this to ensure I don't take another eon to revise this style!</b>

/* For people super-frustrated with the constantly-changing
   code from me updating, I am sincerely apologetic. I will
   update this style more often as I discover more things
   in the Googleverse that needs tweaking.

   I have tried my very best to avoid making any changes to
   search results, and to make this style work to the best
   of my ability on the search and image front pages.
   
   Some things might be missing or broken still, so bear
   with me! The price of keeping current is occasionally
   losing your changes.

   This message will persist in future updates. Changelog
   is in the bottom so people tweaking the code doesn't get
   their lines mixed up. Enjoy! This is update #24. */
