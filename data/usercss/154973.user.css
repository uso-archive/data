@description    `this style does nothing. I just made the image as an template so I know what is shown in the <a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/blob/master/README.md">stylus</a> preview for the styles.the pink vertical lines are the marking points where the stylus preview thumbnail will be cut of the current image. exactly it is cut in the half of the pink lines width, but stretched till the outer point of the pink lines.<br />anyhow it will let you design the style preview image better.<br />If you want to use a font in the image and want be sure that the user can read it. I used <br />to keep it simple here is the direct link to the header image of this style: <br /><a href="https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/154973_after.png">https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/154973_after.png</a><br /><br /><b>note:</b><br />after you updated an image and are impatient you can clean the browser cache. so the new image is loaded instantly.`
