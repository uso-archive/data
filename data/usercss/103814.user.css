@description  Well, Curse again did some really "awesome" changes on their sites, like their forum or the repository of mods. They were that awesome, they... Nah, not here.    What does this style?    • It widens the visibility  • Hides places for ads (Still recommend Adblock, because hiding isn't blocking and so you will still notice some heavy lag - thanks to Curse.com for including a bunch of craploading javascripts!)  • Fixes oversized avatars  • Fixes oversized images  • Fixes annoying long full-quotes (You still can scroll through, but the overview won't get destroyed anymore)  • Fixes annoying long posts, since most users won't use the spoiler-button (Same method like before)  • Many more things.    What does this style NOT do?    • Annoy you with fancy new graphics  • Switching things that were not necessary  • Brew a cup of coffee ;)
