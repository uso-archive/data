@description    `Phoronix's layout is . . .  distracting, to say the least. This makes for a less-pleasant reading experience. This style aims to correct that.What it does:* Hides the ad at the left side of the page* Hides the ad in the "leaderboard" at the top of the page* Hides the headers of the various sections at the right of the screen.* Hides the background image, which looks awful in 16-bit color depth.What it does not do:* Hide the ad at the bottom of the page -- hiding this with CSS would hide the copyright notice.* Hide the ad at the right side of the page -- hiding this with CSS would hide the recent stories and many other useful things.This is version 1.0. I may later rearrange parts of the site as I did with my "Kerneltrap -- Simplified" style (22730)`
