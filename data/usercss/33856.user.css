@description  Phoronix's layout is . . .  distracting, to say the least. This makes for a less-pleasant reading experience. This style aims to correct that.    What it does:    * Hides the ad at the left side of the page  * Hides the ad in the "leaderboard" at the top of the page  * Hides the headers of the various sections at the right of the screen.  * Hides the background image, which looks awful in 16-bit color depth.    What it does not do:    * Hide the ad at the bottom of the page -- hiding this with CSS would hide the copyright notice.  * Hide the ad at the right side of the page -- hiding this with CSS would hide the recent stories and many other useful things.    This is version 1.0. I may later rearrange parts of the site as I did with my "Kerneltrap -- Simplified" style (22730)
