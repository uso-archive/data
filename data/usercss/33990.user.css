@name           Pixiv - fix bookmark category lists

@description    `With the new Pixiv look-and-feel, if you go to the "add a bookmark page" then bookmark categories written in English (and probably other European languages) might have linebreaks added to the middle of them.  This forces linebreaks to only happen between category names.`

/*
 * With the default "display: block", line breaks
 * (line wrapping) for categories on the
 * add-bookmarks page can be done inside of English
 * language words. With this fix, line breaks are only done
 * between category names, and not inside them.
 * Also prevents line breaks from showing up
 * inside tag names in tags lists.
