@description    `todoist is a simple yet effective todolist. it delivers a fast "FLOW" that makes it more productive (for me) than "old" players like tadalist and remember the milk. since i like my apps a bit more colorful i decided to "pimp" it out a bit. i was going for that cool roughunderbelly.com look.came out kinda nifty :)oron mizrachi (requests - mail_me [AT] nana.co.il)to Aliji - in order to replace the logo you'll have to give the #logo>IMG visibility hidden and then give your own logo by attaching a background image to the logo container. that should do it. i did on my delicious vibes skin. you should check it out. enjoy the skin :)`
