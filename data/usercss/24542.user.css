@name         Neowin Atlas2 - Add Scene [12/20/10]
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       jordanriane
@description  Changes layout from fluid to static and includes the header graphic from homepage (you will need to manually change the image URL (or you can use your own.) A few other changes are present that I wanted (font family, font size, subscriber color) but you are free to remove or change to your own desire. Enjoy!    Changelog:  12/20/10 - Updated to increase font-size to reflect previous version's size. Also have the social (facebook + share icons) bar hidden by default.  6/10/10 - Added new Scene and cleaned up the stylesheet a bit to remove deprecated styles and so your homepage style selections are used.  6/05/10 - Adapted the stylesheet for Atlas Pro as all other styles have been removed.  1/25/10 - Changed some of the properties to remove extra (unneeded) lines as well as to differentiate my code from Browno's copy/pasta.      Neowin Scenes - This will override any selection you make on the homepage. Also, if you want to make your own scene, the values to use are 990x135.  http://neowin.net/images/header_images/dusk.jpg  http://neowin.net/images/header_images/win7.jpg  http://neowin.net/images/header_images/streamoflight.jpg  http://neowin.net/images/header_images/bokeh.jpg  http://neowin.net/images/header_images/quattuor.jpg  http://neowin.net/images/header_images/floatingisland.jpg
