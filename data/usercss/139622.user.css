@description  Simply removes those pesky ads in the activity sidebar.    For some reason a lot of other ad removal themes and ad blockers don't affect the ads in the activity sidebar.   So i made a stylish theme that do only one thing. Removes it those specifik ads.    So just combine this theme with whatever else ad remover you prefer.    After the install you will see an empty space where the ads were. Just refresh the page and it will go away.        I have a theme for removing the right column too  https://userstyles.org/styles/139620/remove-right-column
