@description    `[May 30th, 2009]:Complete Overhaul.. row highlighting.. shortened email list... expanded msg list heightIf you prefer the speed of the Classic view, then here's something to push the crappy classic view up a knotch. - Ads removed- Email listing line spacing increased- Row highlighting- "Mark as Unread" and "Print" button removed from listing view. (I never click these so I figured..)- "Web" button for search removed. - Message numbers and page numbers bar removed. There is another one on the bottom. You only need one..- a few other small things..I'm not a pro scripter so there are a few things I wanted to do but couldn't and well, I really just don't have time. Exams are coming up soon.  - The status bar flashes like crazy with the links. It'd be nice if anyone could do a greasemonkey script and get rid of that. - The reply icons don't have transparent backgrounds. Not severe at all. But some people may find it annoying.  [Edited]: Updated[April 24th, 2008]: Fixed a few things. The headers were missing and now the headers are highlighted a different color. [June 21st, 2008]: I decided to retain some of the original theme. They aren't all that bad. `
