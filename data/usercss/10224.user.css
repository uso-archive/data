@namespace    USO Archive
@author       dotter
@description  Red background on sites that fail certificate validation (a more visual warning) so that you browse safely and know visually when something is going wrong    Integrates with Style 8704, along with all my About: page customizations.    Features:  + Appears on any site with a certificate error  + Fully customizable style, for your own enjoyment.  + Passport officer logo as background image top left  + White text  + Red Background - Mozilla standard warning background color    Text of the warning reads:  <<website>> uses an invalid security certificate.  The certificate expired on <<date time>>  (Error code: sec_error_expired_certificate)  This could be a problem with the server's configuration, or it could be someone trying to impersonate the server.  If you have connected to this server successfully in the past, the error may be temporary, and you can try again later.    Also integrates with style 8664    Instructions:  You may also change the background HEX color, as well as the foreground text color.    Browser Versions Supported:  Firefox 3+ only    Changelog:  1.0.0.1:  + Now uses the proper Mozilla Red (used on all other error pages, and about:mozilla)  + Added new after image screenshot to reflect this change
