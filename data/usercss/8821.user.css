@description  Gives you Transparency on all Tooltips (Global style).  ** Must be installed along with Style 8555 for this style to work!! **    * Thanks to for introducing me into the realm of Transparency with style 4120    You can Customize the amount of transparency by editing the Opacity in the code (Closer to 0 is closer to invisible, whereas closer to 1 is closer to fully-visible - EXAMPLE: 0.5 is in the middle of opacity)    This makes your tooltips look really cool.  This style supports only Firefox3, giving it even more of a WOW effect!.    Applies to:  + Navigation Toolbar (Hover over button)  + Hovering on a tab (tooltip will have radius)  + Also Applies to EVERY single item on any web page (Hover over a link)    Additional Information:  + This style has been tested on Multiple Themes! Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has rounded perfectly on each.  Feel free to customize the transparency level (described above) ... no reposting mods though!  * You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.  ** Must be installed along with Style 8555 for this style to work!! **    Browser Versions:  + Works only on Firefox3    Integrates with the following Styles:  + Style 8555  ** Must be installed along with Style 8555 for this style to work!! **  + Style 8818  + Style 8558    Works well with:  + All of the Glasser / Transparent styles  + The Styles Displayed above    Changelog:  1.0.0.1  + Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.
