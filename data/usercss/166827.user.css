@name         Crunchyroll - No fullscreen outline
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Lucas Miranda
@description  This style removes the blue border from fullscreen mode HTML5 player.    Crunchyroll recently replaced its Flash video player with a new HTML5 one, but one of its flaws is the presence of a 1px blue border when in fullscreen mode. This style hides this blue line from the player.
