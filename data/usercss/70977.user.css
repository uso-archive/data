@description    `I love Feedly, the beautiful front end for <strike><del>Google Reader</del></strike>* feed reader. However, my middle-aged eyes don't. The text size for entries and summaries is just too small, and the category labels are too low-contrast. I finally decided to do something about it.So here's a very simple user style to make Feedly as comfortable to read for myopic infofreaks as it is stylish. It should be easy to tweak for your own needs.*Why you gotta break my heart Google man?`
