@name         Underline links and always indicate visited links

@description  Always underline links, indicating the presence of clickable text regardless  of the say-so of a site's Web Design Professionals.    Always dashed-underline visited links, despite the the some sites attempts  to suppress this user-informative annotation.    "text-line-style: dotted" does not appear to work for the visited link annotation,  so instead this uses "border-bottom: 2px dotted" for visited links.    For those of who have been forced to give up on browser.display.use_document_colors,  but still believe that it's *my* browser and should display information of interest  to me, not what some css monkey decides.
