@description  Ever wish there was a way to know if a link would open in the current window or a new one? This userstyle changes the mouse cursor when you hover over a link that opens in a new window.    Note: This version uses Windows cursors. There is also a Mac OS version available:  http://userstyles.org/styles/27253
