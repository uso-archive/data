@description  This is my "work in progress" toward coloring the GMail buttons now their site has changed.  FOR NOW, all the buttons are green - I wanted black, but that screwed up the new Contacts Page Buttons.  I'm working on delineating the individual buttons but it's seemingly rather difficult and I won't have any more time tonight.  Rather a pain, and I've been on it 3 hours already.    My former script here  http://userstyles.org/styles/291    was very popular, but it's not working as of 10/29/07 due to a site change.  GOOD News . . . GMail is much improved, bigger mailbox size, and larger contact photos and contact list controls.  Very cool!
