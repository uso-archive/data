@description  As of the latest 2.0a3 Nightly Branch Builds, you get arrows on either side of tabs, so multiple tabs can be "scrolled."  Kinda cool.  However, I didnt' like the "tiny transparent white" markers - this is a "dramatic color" to show off the end button - but change to your liking.  I colorize active tab "green" and cut opacity on non-active; all I have to do now is make the arrow larger and I'll be set.  White arrow on black background would be cool . . . I'll work on it.
