@name         Color fix for Bloglines Beta
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       tbone
@description  This is a very simple script that changes the new Bloglines Beta's default color (light gray) back to just plain, old black. The idea is to make text easier to read and to reduce eye fatigue. Feeds that contain no unread items will remain gray to make it easier to distinguish between the two.    Please see http://www.bloglines.com/forums/read.php?24,17963 for more information.

* v0.1 - Quick hack, August 08, 2008
* v0.2 - Some users who use other Bloglines scripts, such as the "Bloglines -
*        No Header" style, may notice an extra line break in the upper right
*        hand corner. This can be fixed by deleting one line of code below,
