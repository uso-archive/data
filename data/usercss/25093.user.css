Current Issues:
- Does not fix the Jewel Case (Friend Requests, Messages, and Notifications buttons)
- Does not fix the top of the main content area (including the search bar, Home, Profile, and Account)
- Hides the "Switch to Facebook Lite" bar (if enabled on your account). This is for debugging.

This is a complete work in progress. Nobody related to this project will be held responsible to any damages that occur from the use of this project. It's distributed AS-IS and with no guarantee or warranty, implied or otherwise. Yay.
