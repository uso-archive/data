@description  NOT FINISHED. I uploaded to share my tiny progress and to have a place to put it when it's finished.    For the newest Facebook redesign (as of Wed, Feb 10, 2010)!    Makes Facebook's sidebar and header stay fixed to the page while the rest of the content scrolls. Allows you to get to the sidebar and controls no matter how far down the page you're scrolled.

Current Issues:
- Does not fix the Jewel Case (Friend Requests, Messages, and Notifications buttons)
- Does not fix the top of the main content area (including the search bar, Home, Profile, and Account)
- Hides the "Switch to Facebook Lite" bar (if enabled on your account). This is for debugging.

This is a complete work in progress. Nobody related to this project will be held responsible to any damages that occur from the use of this project. It's distributed AS-IS and with no guarantee or warranty, implied or otherwise. Yay.
