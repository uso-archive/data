@description  Gmail Tabs is an extension for Gmail by CloudHQ<br>The inbox tab is there by default. It's blue underlined, which was changed into red. The default Gmail inbox icon was added to the inbox tab. To get some visual feedback on what you are clicking on, the background of the tabs now changes into light grey on mouse hover. Also, you can click anywhere on a tab to activate it, but the cursor didn't change to indicate that; now it does. All tabs now have a darker grey bottom border. There's an annoying line under the tab icon, which is now removed. When hovering the edit icon, the background hover is a grey rectangular; this was changed in the default Gmail grey circle. In edit mode, the colour of the delete icon was changed to red.
