@name         Hide Connection Status Display Popup - Fx 4+

@description  For Firefox 4+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds.    This hides the connecting, waiting, loading status display messages and link hovered target URLs from showing at bottom of screen, so the Connection Status Display popup flickering won't be annoying. Due to (bug 628654 - Show connecting / waiting / loading status messages in small overlay on top of content at bottom of screen) and (bug 541656 - Display hyperlink URLs at bottom of window (instead of right side of location bar))    Tested on Firefox 4+ and up to latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.    Credit for code goes to:    User dosho on: http://forums.mozillazine.org/    To customize or fix Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds, you can also have a look at my other styles: user 61655
