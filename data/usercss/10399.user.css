@description    `The menu on http://www.amespubliclibrary.org/ is ugly when hovering the mouse over it - the links become bold, and that resizes the menu and makes it harder to read. I've fixed this by making menu items all the same size and changing the background color for mouse hovers.Ideally, the company who made the library website would fix the menu so it works in a way that's not annoying. Until then, enjoy this stylesheet.`

Ames Public Library - Reasonable Menu
by Dan Rasmussen <http://danrasmussen.org>
August 21, 2008.

The menu on http://www.amespubliclibrary.org/ is ugly when hovering the mouse over it - the links become bold, and that resizes the menu and makes it harder to read. I've fixed this by making menu items all the same size and changing the background color for mouse hovers.

Ideally, the company who made the library website would fix the menu so it works in a way that's not annoying. This stylesheet will have to do until then.
