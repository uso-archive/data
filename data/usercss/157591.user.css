@description  i made this for myself because the numbers on statuses and profiles make me anxious    hides the number of toots, follows and followers counts from profiles in the main mastodon interface ( but not from direct profile links )    it also hides the number of boosts and favorites from statuses when you open them in a new column    now hides the toots and followers counts on the explore page    the numbers are invisible but you can still click on the space they would be
