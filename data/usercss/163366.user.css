@name         Remove liked tweets from timeline

@description  In mid-2017 my timeline finally started including tweets that other people "liked". Not retweeted, just clicked "like".  At times it was a third of my feed or more. Since LIKES ARE NOT SHARES (cc Facebook), this style hides them.    Updated by @zlapper, initial version by @mildmojo, released under CC0.
