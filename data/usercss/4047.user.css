@description    `I was sick of all the crap surrounding books when reading them in HTML mode, so I whipped up a quick and dirty CSS script to remove all the distracting backgrounds and useless stuff (including the giant images on the homepage). I honestly don't know if it produces any rendering bugs other than the obvious (that a couple images may look odd since I didn't bother replacing them).Also, I removed the navigation for O'Reilly, if you want that back, remove #headerNavigation > tbody > tr:first-child from the script.Another darn problem I kept having was that the next-page links were too small and the pages felt hard to read from lack of white space. So I increased the size of the left and right bars, solving both problems in one go.`
