@description  Version 0.1    This script moves the new search box for the forum guide pages, which is easily ignored at the foot of the page, to a prominent position near the top of the page. It also restricts its height so that it doesn't actually appear there (apart from a scroll bar on the right), and it uses a fake search button as a reminder for what it does. Move the mouse into the area between search button and scroll bar, and the foot of the page opens automagically there. Leave the area and it closes again.
