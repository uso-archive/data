@description  All it does is make the backgound a gif of stars.  Works best with the dark themes, regular SWX theme is too wide.    If you want to change the background to anything, its really simple since this is like 6 lines of code.  Just install it, press "Edit" under the themes name in your stylish extension, and change the URL of the image to whatever URL you want.
