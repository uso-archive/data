@name           Trello - Image-Less Cards
@namespace      USO Archive
@author         AmerSoft
@description    `This style will remove the image from the cards on your selected board, that will save a lot of extra space especially if you have too many cards.      You can use it for all of your boards (the default option) or you can use it for specific board(s), see attached images to know how to select only one board.`
