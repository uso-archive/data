@name         Canada Post Tracking - Clean

@description  Very simple one. Cleans up the page when you're tracking a package.   What you see on the screenshot is supposed to be what's left on the page (works at the moment of posting).    Applies to the tracking page only, i.e. starting with:  https://www.canadapost.ca/cpotools/apps/track/personal/findByTrackNumber    Although please feel free to customize that, or anything else. Also might be helpful if you are looking to learn, since it's about the simplest style there is.
