@description  Simple global grey background! Very easy on the eyes and doesn't screw up website formatting! It eliminates that annoying light reflection on your screen that you get with a background that's too dark! It is great for reading lots of text and figures that you don't want to mess up. If this doesn't convince you to go grey, change the color to what ever you like!
