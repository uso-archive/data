@description  Centers ALL pages.  WARNING: Messes up the layout of many pages (including userstyles.org) that don't have a layout based on tables. To prevent that, remove the margin-left and margin-right settings (page will only be centered vertically afterwards).    Edit: Good to see this style is still liked (and still works in Firefox 3.0). And it doesn't seem to break this site any more, either.  Thanks for the reviews. I don't think you can add exceptions for single pages. Also, this style might break in future versions because changing the style of the HTML node is sort of a hack and is afaik not standards conform.  Well, whatever, keep enjoying it as long as possible.
