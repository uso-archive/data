@description  Version 0.2    This little script removes the My Chat, My Subscriptions and My Friends sections from the My Forums or Forums Settings page. If you don't use these forum functions (does anyone?) this script frees up a lot of space.    Version 0.1: initial version.    Version 0.2 changes:  July 30th, 2008: about.com seem to have changed the structure of the Forums Settings page, adding in another div, which breaks version 0.1 and renders it useless. Version 0.2 reflects the change and removes the sections again. However, the old code remains in the file for the moment in case about.com are just testing and change it back eventually. The patterns used are mutually eclusive so the old code shouldn't be able to cause problems.
