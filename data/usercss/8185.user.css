@description  White background for the site Dumpr.net - a online photo editing suite which allows you to perform Photoshop-like effects on your images.    Features:  + Makes dumpr look much more professional by removing the orange background  + More attractive and business-like  + Looks a lot less like a freeware, ad infested site (like it did before this style)    Feel free to customize the background color.  I thought white was best.    Changelog:  - Initial Release
@version      20080620.15.06
@license      NONE
@preprocessor uso
