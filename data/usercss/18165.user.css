@description  This fixes the line spacing on MAL so that it's not xbox hueg.    Description was overwritten during the great "OH NOES ADULT CONTENT PROTECT THE CHILDREN" purge which apparently happened back in December 2012, without notifying userstyle authors that it was going to happen, so I remained unaware until hellshikoku on MAL PMed me about it, in April 2014.
