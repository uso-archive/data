@description    `This Stylish script reverses the font change Youtube put in place May 13th 2015. Site wide they changed from a basic Arial font to Roboto, which has issues being displayed on a variety of systems / browsers. This script resets it so that all of Youtube.com is see in the original font they had prior to this change.`
