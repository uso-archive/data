@name           OKCupid - Remove matches from homepage
@namespace      USO Archive
@author         alpha1971
@description    `This script removes the annoying block of three matches who one might supposedly want to meet (but actually never do) from the okcupid.com / okcupid homepage. It also removes the equally pointless picture of yourself, on the basis that you are likely to know what you look like already (or if not, probably don't want reminding).`
