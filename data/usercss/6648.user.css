@description  Tired of only having half of the page width to edit journals with? Simply enable this style while you're editing and the "Journal Entries" column will disappear, allowing the "New Journal Entry" column to take up the whole page width.    Edit: I originally made it, by mistake, so that the bloody thing only works when making a _new_ journal. Now it's fixed to work when updating old journals as well.
