@description    `This userstyle was not written by me, but by Reddit user gavin19.  (However, I have his blessing to put it up on here.)  It completely removes all instances of karma from the Reddit website.The idea behind hiding Reddit's karma values is to encourage people to be themselves and not care so much about whether their comments or posts are likely to get positive or negative karma.  Karma can lend itself easily to groupthink ... it's a fundamental human need to have the approval of your peers.`
