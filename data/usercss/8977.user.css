@description  Auto-Hides the Firefox Sidebar until you hover your mouse over it.    This style is an Entirely new take on the Previously-Attempted auto-hide side bar styles.  This style works and performs Amazing!    * Thanks to user 1573 AND user 5732 for the Similar Ideas and Code    Instructions:  1. Install the style  2. Move your mouse over to the right-hand side of screen  3. Slowly move your mouse over towards the Sidebar until the RESIZE icon appears as your mouse icon  4. Resize the sidebar to be as small as you can make it.  5. Enjoy the smallest sidebar when browsing, and when you hover over it, it will become un-compressed!    Customizations:  + This style also allows you to customize the size of the sidebar when it is hovered over.  Currently it is at 500px but it can be increased or decreased easily in the code (look for my comments)    Applies to:  + Web page in a sidebar  + History Sidebar  + Bookmarks Sidebar  + Stylish Sidebar  + Countless other sidebars, All automatically compacted and compressed!    Browser Versions:  - Works on Firefox 3  - Works on Firefox 3 FINAL.  - Works on Firefox 2    Similar Styles:  For those of you who want to autohide their Bookmarks Toolbar, check out this - Style 7461  For those of you who want the Sidebar Title on the Right and the Sidebar Close Button on the Left, Install this style - Style 8989    About:Screenshots:  + For those of you with Firefox 3, take a look at the after screenshot to see an animation of the style in action!    Changelog:  1.0.0.3:  + The Autopager extension has been fixed, the code supplied is no longer required  - Removed Autopager workaround code.    1.0.0.2:  + Added support code for the new Firefox Extension, "Autopager"  + Fixed bug where installing the Auto Pager add-on would prevent the auto-hiding feature.  + Code for this bugfix is Commented Out below the regular code - just replace normal code with the commented-out code    1.0.0.1:  + Code Cleanup - Added more Comments to aide users in the customizations, made code tidier.
