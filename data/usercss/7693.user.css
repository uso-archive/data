@description    `Facebook's iPhone interface is a *great* sidebar, but it needs some tweaks.  I reduced the size of the text a bit, and allowed for images to wrap properly.  I unfortunately had to remove the copyright notice to keep the logout buttons looking right, but it remains clean.  To use this properly, you need to have the Facebook iPhone page in your bookmarks as a sidebar.  To do this, simply go to "Bookmark"s --> "Organize Bookmarks..." and find a good place for the bookmark (like your bookmark toolbar) and right-click and select "New Bookmark..."  Put what you want in Name, Keywords, and Description, put "http://iphone.facebook.com/#home.php" in for location (no quotes), and make sure to check the box that says "Load this bookmark in the sidebar."`
