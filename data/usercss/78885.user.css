@description    `Since facebook now places ads directly in your newsfeed (covered as "sponsored stories" or similar),I searched for a way to block this crap. Now I think I've found a way to hide these commercial updates.I've tested it for a while, but I'm not sure it just hides the ads,so please check it a few days, if there are some entries that accidently have been blocked.Use it on your own risk!`
