@description  Since facebook now places ads directly in your newsfeed (covered as "sponsored stories" or similar),  I searched for a way to block this crap. Now I think I've found a way to hide these commercial updates.    I've tested it for a while, but I'm not sure it just hides the ads,  so please check it a few days, if there are some entries that accidently have been blocked.    Use it on your own risk!
