@description  Enable this CSS to make every piece 'hover-able'; their individual display will correspond to the name of the piece. You could consider it a plug-in, I guess! :D  I was initially planning to create this for me only, because I have some difficulties with chinese. But I discovered Stylish in the meantime! :)
