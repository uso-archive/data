@description    `Allows you to Customize the focus-color of  web buttons.  When you have a button focused, it is very hard to see where your focus is.  This style fixes the problem with focus by changing the button's background and foreground colors to stand out to the user.Increases screen navigation and readability.  This style customizes the button color based on its function (if focused, it will turn green...)Once again, this style supports both Firefox2 and Firefox3.  Fully Customizable colors - simply edit the HEX codes.Fixes bug with Highlight Focus and Configuration Mania Addons, where they would not change the buttons back to black text when not focused (This was only a problem in Firefox 3).Functions / Features:+ Non-Focused Buttons are Black Text / Button Background (based on theme)+ Focused Buttons are Lime-Green text / Black BackgroundApplies to:+ Any single button on a web page (example: Google Search button)Browser Versions:- Works on Firefox 3- Works on Firefox 2 (Though it was created to fix a bug on Firefox 3)Works with Style 12981And Style 7743Integrates Well with the following Firefox Extensions:+ Highlight Focus+ Configuration ManiaAbout:Screenshot:- Before Screenshot shows what my Focused buttons looked like without the style, but WITH configuration mania and Highlight Focus installed.Changelog:1.0.0.7:- Removed Input code from this style.
