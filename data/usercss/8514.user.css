@name         Custom WebPage Button Focus Color (Add-on Fix)
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       dotter
@description  Allows you to Customize the focus-color of  web buttons.  When you have a button focused, it is very hard to see where your focus is.  This style fixes the problem with focus by changing the button's background and foreground colors to stand out to the user.      Increases screen navigation and readability.  This style customizes the button color based on its function (if focused, it will turn green...)  Once again, this style supports both Firefox2 and Firefox3.  Fully Customizable colors - simply edit the HEX codes.  Fixes bug with Highlight Focus and Configuration Mania Addons, where they would not change the buttons back to black text when not focused (This was only a problem in Firefox 3).    Functions / Features:  + Non-Focused Buttons are Black Text / Button Background (based on theme)  + Focused Buttons are Lime-Green text / Black Background    Applies to:  + Any single button on a web page (example: Google Search button)    Browser Versions:  - Works on Firefox 3  - Works on Firefox 2 (Though it was created to fix a bug on Firefox 3)    Works with Style 12981  And Style 7743    Integrates Well with the following Firefox Extensions:  + Highlight Focus  + Configuration Mania    About:Screenshot:  - Before Screenshot shows what my Focused buttons looked like without the style, but WITH configuration mania and Highlight Focus installed.    Changelog:  1.0.0.7:  - Removed Input code from this style.  Please install Style 12981 to fully complete this fix.  + Now Ubiquity popup text is readable (white text)    1.0.0.6:  + Added more File: buttons for even more support    1.0.0.5:  + Popup prompts no longer override the black background.    1.0.0.4:  + Added support for File Attachments and Upload Browse textboxes and buttons    1.0.0.3:  + Added More support for buttons with ID and regular input type buttons  + Added code to apply only to web sites (no longer global)    1.0.0.2:  + Added Support for Reset buttons  + Added Support for Regular (non-action) buttons    1.0.0.1:  + Fixed possible issue with dark buttons (dark sites) or customized button text.
