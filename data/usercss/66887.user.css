@description  This isn't a good style, not by a long shot.  I did mostly make it for myself, because I was so frustrated  by the new images and layout. Still hope they'll turn that back..    So yeah, this turns fanfiction.net a bit more into how it was before they implemented those lovely, unnecessarily profile pictures.
