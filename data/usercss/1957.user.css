@name         Make and Hacks Magazines: fluid width, no sidebar

@author       b0at
@description  This sets up a fluid width and removes the huge sidebar (often longer than the main content) and those big ads for print versions on makezine.com and hackszine.com.    For a more minimal layout, try http://userstyles.org/styles/3798
