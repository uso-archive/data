/* ===============  Overall Comments  ======================
- Experiment & change the above colors (defined in RGB) to
your preference.
- This Style was tested on Firefox 2.0 using its default
theme "Firefox (default) 2.0", which automatically grades
the color vertically.  The color that you set in the code
seems to be the color at the very bottom of the tab.
- This style was initially written with
   - Selected Tab RGB=205,225,252   a light blue.
   - Non-selected Tabs RGB=255,250,235   a very light gray.
- This style does not have code related to
hovering/mousing-over (nor related to the close-out button
other than the background surrounding it).  With the default
theme, hovering over a tab results in:
   - For the Selected Tab, all stays the same.
   - For a Non-selected Tab, all color becomes lighter. (Its
close-out button stays the same gray until directly
hovered over.)
- General note:  For people who prefer setting colors as
RGB, the existing code for any color in any Style can be
modified by using the format shown in the above code.
