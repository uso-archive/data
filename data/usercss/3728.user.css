@description  This Style uses Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color definition for the background color of the  Browsing Selected Tab and Non-selected Tabs.  You can experiment & change these 2 colors to your  preference.  This Style can be used in combination with style 4329 .  ::  This Style was tested on Firefox 2.0 using its default theme "Firefox (default) 2.0".  Code starting point was style 2019 .  ::  SOME DETAILS:  ::  Firefox 2.0's default theme "Firefox (default) 2.0", automatically grades  the color vertically.  The color that you set in the code seems to be the color at the very bottom of the tab.  ::  This Style does not have code related to hovering/mousing-over (nor related to the close-out button other  than the background surrounding it).  Note that with Firefox's default theme, hovering over a tab results in:     - For the Selected Tab, all stays the same.     - For a Non-selected Tab, all color becomes lighter.  (Its close-out button stays the same gray out  until directly hovered over.)  ::  General Note:  For people who prefer setting colors as RGB, the existing code for any color in any Style  can be modified by using the format shown in this Style's code.  ::  ::  NOTE: THE SCREENSHOTS CAN BE ENLARGED BY RIGHT-CLICKING EACH > View Image.

/* ===============  Overall Comments  ======================
- Experiment & change the above colors (defined in RGB) to
your preference.
- This Style was tested on Firefox 2.0 using its default
theme "Firefox (default) 2.0", which automatically grades
the color vertically.  The color that you set in the code
seems to be the color at the very bottom of the tab.
- This style was initially written with
   - Selected Tab RGB=205,225,252   a light blue.
   - Non-selected Tabs RGB=255,250,235   a very light gray.
- This style does not have code related to
hovering/mousing-over (nor related to the close-out button
other than the background surrounding it).  With the default
theme, hovering over a tab results in:
   - For the Selected Tab, all stays the same.
   - For a Non-selected Tab, all color becomes lighter. (Its
close-out button stays the same gray until directly
hovered over.)
- General note:  For people who prefer setting colors as
RGB, the existing code for any color in any Style can be
modified by using the format shown in the above code.
