@description  Since Google Inc. is operating Youtube we'd noticed that there are more and more ad positions. Because of my small screen it forces me to scroll down if I want to see the related videos. For that reason I wrote some simple custom css styles to hide them. They'll be loaded anyway but you won't see them anymore. So, don't worry: Google will get the money for your view as well ;-)    Note: The video ads and the ads inside the player can't be hidden by CSS!
