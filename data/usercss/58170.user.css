@description    `I was planning on adding it to my other style: style 58169, but since the playlist/favorite bar is a useful (Non the less, annoying) tool, i decided to make a style just for it. That way you can disable this style anytime you want the playlist/favorite bar to spawn at the bottom without moving anything to the video player.This works great along with my other style: style 58169 The only difference is that this one works on every browser, every screen resolution.`
