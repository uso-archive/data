@name         Adjustable Width Channel Pane
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       TheTopMostDog
@description  Allows you to resize the channel pane to maximize the chat message-area as you see fit.    There is currently no minimum or maximum width set on the column, so you can go as far in either direction as your browser allows [subject to change] - please be careful with this, and simply refresh to load defaults if you have any issues.    Also removed some horizontal padding present on the channel names themselves, and moved the voicechat participants over a bit to retain better functionality while using a very narrow channel pane.    Designed to be compatible with my other modular Discord stylesheets, and will ultimately be included in a "compact Discord" style once I've 'dealt with' each section of the default Discord window.
