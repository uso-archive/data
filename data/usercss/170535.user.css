@description  Gray mode  This style is not cool.  This style is necessary for protect my eyes.  If I see display in perfect white site,it's same as staring at the lights.  No way.  Physically, real white papers should probably be darker than the lights.  Lights are should probably be lighter than a real white papers.  Eyes are more important than the power consumption of display.  Dark mode are more populer,but contrast is very high.  Gray mode brings to me that The black is blacker and the white is whiter.  you know,I should have to change to this style.  This style is not cool.but,protect my eyes.
