@description  about:blank    version 0.1.1      --[description]    Default window manager "3D Object" surface color, on the about:blank background.    Quite blank, really.    Thanks to user 15142 for showing the cross-platform way to do this.  In my version 0.1.0 I had used the "windows default grey" color.    Side note:  Placing images or odd colors (magenta or yellow, for instance) in about:blank is a terrible idea.  about:blank is used in many other places in FireFox, where you wouldn't expect.  I've also seen plenty of stupid websites end up with it in their page content.  IFrames, for instance.  And it's a Cross Site Scripting risk if you put real content in about:blank.      I've placed proof of the above statement in the Before Screenshot, and briefly document it here: http://www.honestlyillustrated.com/userstyles/stylishguide/stylishguide.html#about:blank      --[series]    The "paintless" series is a collection of styles meant to be styled over.  Alone, they clean the target page(s), preparing them for further styling with hopefully the least possible selector specificity.    Writing your style to overlay this one will save you from having to include this code version in yours.  Users can load both, and they'll get my updates without needing you to notice the update.  Write your style correctly, and my updates shouldn't damage your styles.  Instruct your style users properly, and perhaps they won't be annoyed at the extra clicking.      --[relevant]    See also:  http://userstyles.org/styles/search/paintless  style 4737  style 10847
