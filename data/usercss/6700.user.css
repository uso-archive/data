@description  updated May 08, 2009 took opacity out and now it just makes your vlinks hotpink, since this is how i been usin for months now and like it best.    updated Dec. 27, 08 to work better on light and dark pages, really not in mood to update the images. They would be the same except this version works excellent for dark and light background websites. Give it a try.    Gives Visited links a slight opacity look and makes them hotpink.    Tweak to your liking.
