@name         Highlight Every Focused Element (HighlightFocus)
@namespace    USO Archive

@description  Allows you to Customize the focus-color of  web forms.  When you have a textbox, checkbox, radiobutton, textarea, or button focused, it is very hard to see where your focus is.  This style fixes the problem with focus by changing the area's background and foreground colors to stand out to the user.      Increases screen navigation and readability.  This style customizes the color based on its function (if focused, it will turn green...)  Once again, this style supports both Firefox2 and Firefox3.  Fully Customizable colors - simply edit the HEX codes.  Now there is no need to install Highlight Focus or Configuration Mania Addons, where they would not change the buttons back to black text when not focused (This was only a problem in Firefox 3).    Functions / Features:  + Non-Focused form objects are Black Text / Button Background (based on theme)  + Focused Buttons are Lime-Green text / Black Background  + Ubiquity text will now show up and will be easily readable!    Applies to:  + Text Boxes  + Text Areas (comment areas)  + Check Boxes  + Radio Buttons  + Select (Option) Menus    + Any single button on a web page (example: Google Search button)    Browser Versions:  - Works on Firefox 3  - Works on Firefox 2    Integrates Completely with:  + Style 8514    Disable the following Firefox Extensions:  - Highlight Focus  - Configuration Mania      Changelog:  - Initial Public Release
