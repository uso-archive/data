@description  This gets rid of the new titles that appeared on December 16, 2019.  The green background with a white font that are on each sentence's page and on the main logged-in home page.  Possibly, this corrects the problem elsewhere on the website, too.    Also, this gets rid of the green behind the second message on the right side of the Wall.    This is likely useful for members with vision problems.
