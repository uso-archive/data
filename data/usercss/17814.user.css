@description  Find yourself getting distracted by having easy access to all the mail that you've archived so as not to let it distract you?    This CSS removes all links (a tags) to "All Mail"    (If you need to get there in the future, click on "Inbox". Then, in the URL, replace "inbox" with "all" and hit enter. In other words, go to: http://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#all)    This is a handy site to understand the code: http://kimblim.dk/css-tests/selectors/
