@description    `www.sj.se - narrower reservation pageFor us who like to have two browser windows side by side on the screen. Or for them who have screens with very low resolution.Make the reservation pages of www.sj.se narrower by removing the left navigation box. You can still navigate by the top navigation bar. The total width is reduced from ca 770px to ca 620px.Update: since some time, their web page is re-designed and this style is not needed any more (obsolete).`
