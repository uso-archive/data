@description  A lot of sites embed medium.com articles on their pages. They often have a fat bottom bar that takes a lot of precious vertical space.<br />  <br />  This plugin hides the bottom bar.<br />  https://imgur.com/a/GRfXQ<br />  <br />  I apply this style not to single site, but to everything, because a lot of sites embed medium posts and I see their bottom bar quite often.
