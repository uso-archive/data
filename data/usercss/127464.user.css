@name         Fark - Remove ads disguised as headlines
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       p4riah
@description  With the Fark layout changes in April 2016 my ad and script blockers stopped being able to block the adverts that are in amongst the headlines. I whipped this up in two minutes to hide the class that those ads use. I created this purely for personal use with my specific plug-in and style configurations, so it might have unintended effects with your config, but figured I'd share. Use at your own risk, etc etc.
