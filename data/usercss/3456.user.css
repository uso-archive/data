@description  Did you plan to watch a recorded game later with some mates tonight, but did the mistake to see the LIVE score on the DN.se front page?    This style hides the LIVE sport scores displayed on the front page, the 'Sport' section, and any other pages on DN.se.  The LIVE games are still listed and the scores can still be retrieved by a single click.
