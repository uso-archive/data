@description  With this Add-on, you will be able to get the old "Hello, ____" greeting when you entered the homepage of Roblox.     y'all ignore this grammar i just want it to look pleasant sobbing rq    update july 5th: seems like roblox removed this feature too so this extension doesn't work anymore. if someone ever finds away to get this back, the extension may work. :((
