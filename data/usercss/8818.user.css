@description  Gives you Transparency on all menus, poups and toolbar drop-downs.  ** Must be installed along with Style 8414 for this style to work!! **    * Thanks to user 6431 for introducing me into the realm of Transparency with style 6771    You can Customize the amount of transparency by editing the Opacity in the code (Closer to 0 is closer to invisible, whereas closer to 1 is closer to fully-visible - EXAMPLE: 0.5 is in the middle of opacity)    This makes your menus look really cool.  This style supports only Firefox3, giving it even more of a WOW effect!.    Applies to:  + File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Tools and Help menus  + Navigation Toolbar (example: right clicking on back button)  + Main Context Menu (Right clicking on any web page)  + Right-Clicking on a tab (rounds the menus)  + Right-Clicking on the Location Bar (address bar)  + Also Applies to EVERY single menu on any window of a popup or pane        Additional Information:  + This style has been tested on Multiple Themes! Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has rounded perfectly on each.  Feel free to customize the transparency level (described above) ... no reposting mods though!  * You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.  ** Must be installed along with Style 8414 for this style to work!! **    Browser Versions:  + Works on Firefox3  + Works on SongBird    Integrates with the following Styles:  + Style 8414  ** Must be installed along with Style 8414 for this style to work!! **  + Style 8028    Works well with:  + All of the Glasser (Vista Glass) / Transparent styles  + The Styles Displayed above      Changelog:  1.0.0.2:  + Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.    1.0.0.1  + Added Huge Update to decrease the transparency when your mouse hovers over the menus.  + This update makes the menus easier to read when your navigating them.  + You can customize this new feature to make them entirely opaque when hovering (or any other level of transparency)
