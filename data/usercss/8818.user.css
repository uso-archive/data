Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has rounded perfectly on each.Feel free to customize the transparency level (described above) ... no reposting mods though!* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.** Must be installed along with Style 8414 for this style to work!! **Browser Versions:+ Works on Firefox3+ Works on SongBirdIntegrates with the following Styles:+ Style 8414** Must be installed along with Style 8414 for this style to work!! **+ Style 8028Works well with:+ All of the Glasser (Vista Glass) / Transparent styles+ The Styles Displayed aboveChangelog:1.0.0.2:+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.1.0.0.1+ Added Huge Update to decrease the transparency when your mouse hovers over the menus.+ This update makes the menus easier to read when your navigating them.+ You can customize this new feature to make them entirely opaque when hovering (or any other level of transparency)`
