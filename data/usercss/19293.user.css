@description  Here's another page-cleaning style, for Time.com. I read and enjoy their site, but think it's hilarious that this media outlet which calls it self "Time" aims to make you waste the stuff with a steady stream of mid-story links to articles that are often only barely related to what you're reading.  These "see" links irritate me -- I find they can interrupt the flow of what is an otherwise well-written article.  (See the Top 10 usages of the word "flow".)    See what I mean?  Well, now you don't have to.    Also, I've found this combines well with style 17982 by user 4241.
