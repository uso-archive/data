@description    `FSdaily please don't put the ads on the left, they destroy the page. Please place you're ads in a less jarring location, so it doesn't interrupt the content. :) Thanks. To use this you need also the firefox adblock add-on. This style will increase the size of the content area, hide the breadcrumb, as well as shift the content so it aligns flush left. I am also rocking the Firefox Nasa theme, if you wanted to know.`
