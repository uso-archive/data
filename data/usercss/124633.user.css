@author         Nanako Glasgow
@description    `I don't personally agree with a forumhaving a voting sytem, and i've encountered some provlems with it, so i made this little sheet to disable itWhen used this sheet will cause posts on the forum to no longer display a rating, and to not have thumb up or thumb down buttons. For all intents and purposes, the rating system ceases to exist as far as you're concerned.`
