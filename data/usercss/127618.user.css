@description  Removes advertisements on <a href="http://friendproject.net/">FriendProject</a>.<br />  Updates will be released as I work through each element that needs to be added in order to completely remove the advertisement sections. This script is currently stable. It hides all of the ads, but leaves "Upgrade to Remove Ads" where it should be. I'm working on fixing that.<br />  ──↝⊰ ∙✦∙ ⊱↜──<br />  <b>Previously known as <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/226887"><i>unholymaster</i></a>, my last account was banned, so I'm reposting all of my styles.</b>
