@description  This is a simple tweak to hide the annoying, useless, never-updated Donation widget from thecolorless.net's forum sidebar.     This should be compatible with all other thecolorless.net userstyles, as it only targets the donation widget's unique div class.    The sidebar widget used to have a live-counter for Paypal donations, which has been broken for 3+ years. There is also no point to the badly/un-managed Patreon linked in the widget. Seeing how neither is actually maintained by the admin in any real sense and the sidebar widget does nothing but clutter up the page, I figured a simple element hiding userstyle would not go amiss.
