@name         Hide "Verified" Badges

@description  Verification is complex, requiring popularity and a reason to truly be verified by a website. That's no fair compared to paying for "pro" or being an employee at a company, so let's level the playing field by hiding the badges! None for anyone as Xane should have one too! Anyone should be able to get verified. If their proof is valid, make them "verified"; Popularity means nothing for verification, so it's a flawed system.    This only works on YouTube, Twitter, Twitch and Facebook at the moment. If you see one of these checkmark-badges anywhere, start a discussion linking to one. After I've fixed it, change your feedback type to positive if it's negative!    Do note that due to Stylish/Stylus limitations, these stupid badges can't be removed within iframes. If only that would become possible!
