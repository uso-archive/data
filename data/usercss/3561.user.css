@description  I got frustrated with the cow mascon of RTM and decided to get rid of it, and in the process came to add some more tweaks to otherwise handy service. So, what you get:    * Byeeee, cow logo!  * Font family changed to arial which is more comfortable for me;  * Font-size for the list of tasks have been increased to make them more visible (or more web2.0-ish if you like). Anyway, those small default font-sizes are dull.    Let's name it "RTM Hacks v.0.1".    Best served with:  - style 3284  - style 1623    === 2008-03-31, rev.2:  * Task name is on the new line.  * Checkboxes are aligned to the top of the rows, making them more aligned with the first line of the task. (Tags get in the way, but I don't know what exactly to do with them â€” it's a choice to either align checkbox to normal text or to tag text, and it's tough to decide.)    === Discussion: http://www.rememberthemilk.com/forums/tips/4236/
