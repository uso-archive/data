@description    `This Style is for people who have never signed into Google SearchWiki. It removes all the Google SearchWiki pre-sign-in stuff and makes the page plain old Google again.I'll be updating this Style as necessary - SearchWiki looks awful and I plan on avoiding it - all traces of it - for at least a few more months.This Style is not for you if you've signed into Google SearchWiki and now you want to remove all the clutter from the page. You'll need to find another Style or a Greasemonkey Script.It's written for google.com version0.02 (30 June 2009) A Google change made it stop working. I updated/changed it to use title to hide the buttons.0.01 First version (23 Nov 2008)`
