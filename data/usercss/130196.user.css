@name         Habitica: Hide Reward Items
@namespace    USO Archive

@description  Hide reward items on the Habitica tasks page.  This is particularly useful after using the Orb of Rebirth,  as the reward items list can be <i>very</i> long. This makes it difficult to reach the items below the list.
