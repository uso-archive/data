@name           RPH RPHaven RP Haven- Dock on Left

@author         Rosen Janus
@description    `I'm not a professional web designer. Issues may arise! I moved the dock to the left, and switched the buttons around by using margins to how they were pre-March-10th.As my friend puts it: "Your mouse is going to be in the left area more anyway. It seems... wrong to have the list on the right. Especially when you can accidentally click something else you never intended to click! The dock is your hub! It deserves area all to its own!"`
