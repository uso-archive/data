@description  This simple style makes more efficient use of space in the Outlook (formerly Windows Live mail) mail page.    Reduced margins and padding around folders and messages means you can see more on-screen at a time. The footer and right column are also hidden, so you won't get ads or other things distracting you while you work.    PS. to get even more space to view messages when using a preview pane on the right, go into Display Settings and disable the message preview line to get 2 lines per mail instead of 3. You can also go into Quick Settings in the beta skin and turn off 'Group messages by date' for even more space.
