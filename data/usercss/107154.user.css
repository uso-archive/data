@name         YouTube: Fix broken checkboxes (Firefox, Aurora)
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Xaymar
@description  This "bug" affects some Firefox users, aswell as Aurora users. It was introduced by a certain multi-million dollar company being unable to read documentation and misusing the -moz-appearance css option. This stylesheet fixes it by setting it to the correct value, hopefully until they fuck up the next thing.    First screenshot is with the stylesheet, second one is without.
