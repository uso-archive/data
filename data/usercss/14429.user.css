@description  *** This applies to all of the gawker media sites, including --    domain("lifehacker.com"), domain("gizmodo.com"),  domain("i.gizmodo.com"), domain("gizmodo.com"), domain("valleywag.com"), domain("gawker.com"), domain("jezebel.com"), domain("defamer.com"), domain("jalopnik.com"), domain("io9.com"), domain("deadspin.com"), domain("consumerist.com"), domain("kotaku.com")    So you can't have a screenshot :)    Originally, I tweaked http://userstyles.org/styles/6616 a bunch. I deleted the sections in there about modifying the placement of the search bar, I widened it to look really nice at 1920*1200, and did some other minor tweaking.        *10-15-09*  Spent my morning eating Twix Bars and editing. Thanks Gawker for messing up my style. All repaired. I removed consumerist, being they aren't a Gawker site anymore. Might be more coming soon, but this will at least keep you going.    *10-15-09*  Yep, fourth tweak. I'm learing css more than I cared to.    *10-19-09*  Ok, After reading Devo's comments, I edited it to be % not absolute px. So, should size better. I also fixed the comments issue. It was being borked by code that I left in from an previous comment hack. I also made the comments a ton wider. If you need more edits, leave feedback!    *01-18-10*  Dammit Gawker, stop effing with your css. Let me know if There's something I missed. As to the gallery links, There's a greasemonkey script to fix that. Get it @ http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/59965    *01-19-10*  Ok, back to using % instead of absolute px. If you want to tweak it, feel free to edit the code and increase/decrease the percentages.  (content_container, container and content are the main ones that you can tweak.)
