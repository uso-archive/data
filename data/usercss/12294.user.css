@description    `Makes gmail chat more compact by reducing space between lines, also making messages like "sent at 2:38" more compactYou can also have more space by uncommenting the font modifying row in the script.Use the source, you can tweak the height of the chat window also.Note: you can see the timestamp after installing it (but I compressed the png, that's why you cannot see on the screenshot)You may also be interested in style 12292 by me, and style 12704 by user 17420You can leave comments on the page`
