@description  Gives you Rounded Toolbar Buttons on all menus and windows.  These buttons will appear as circles when hovered    * Thanks to user 5424 for introducing me into the "Wellrounded" types of styling with style 8366    This makes your toolbar buttons look really cool, and with this style enabled, hovering over buttons will make them have rounded edges.  This style supports Firefox3 and Firefox2.    Applies to:  - Bookmarks Toolbar  - Toolbar buttons  - Any Extensions' Toolbar Buttons  - Menu buttons inside Extensions Options  - ANY Window that has buttons on it.      Additional Information:  + Removing the comments from my code will allow you to change the buttons from full circles to slightly rounded.  + Uses new CSS3 Circular Radius Supercode!    Browser Versions:  + Works on Firefox3  + Now works on Firefox 2      Works well with:  + Style 8414  + All of the WellRounded styles      Changelog:  1.0.0.1:  + Added Firefox 2 (Legacy) support
