@name         Neopets.com - Sidebar Removal [Shops/Galleries]
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Fuzio
@description  This style will remove the Sidebar (Neopet and Neofriend Module) from all Shops and Galleries.    Why is this useful you ask?  For Premium Users, it's extremely useful because you will no longer have to scroll to the right to buy items when using the SSW.  I think Neopets should or might do this themselves in the future, but for now I use this.    If there's anything you feel I've missed or should add, let me know! ^^
