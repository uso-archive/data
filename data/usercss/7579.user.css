@description  Automatically hides the Stop Button based on the current state of the web page.    * Thanks to user 4639's Idea!    Features:  -If you cannot Stop the page, the Stop button is removed.    -Hides the Stop button after you click it.  -When a page is finished loading, the stop button will disappear!      Gives you a larger area, and more screenspace for your browser...They only display when required!    Works for both Firefox 3 and Firefox 2.  Why install an extension to do this, when you can do it through CSS!?    Special Stop button that only appears when you need it (nothing to stop).  Visually notifies you if you have a page to stop to by enabling the button!    Integrates with Style 7577, and Style 7575, allowing you to remove the Back and Forward icons until something to go back or forward to, and the Home toolbar Button.    Changelog:  -Initial Release
@version      20080527.12.53
