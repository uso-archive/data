@description  Just a little hack-fix to style 28563 *OR* style 4955 both by user 635 Hopefully the original author will come out with an official (and prettier!) fix soon, but until then I can't stand looking at the glaring white, so this kills it and fixes the tabs up a bit as well.    I've tested it with the non-rounded version, but don't see why it wouldn't work with the rounded version as well.    You must have the SKYY's style for this to work, this is just an addon!    Update 2010-06-17: Fixed some more white areas that recently appeared in the header and left sidebar. Also fixed the inline "code" element which had a white background and was unreadable.
