@description    `www.imdb.com recently updated their website with a modified design putting the pages into a fixed width.That's all very well, but i like viewing this particular website at 100% width.Use the following small style to get it back to 100% width.Screenshots not provided as it's such a small code, i'll include screenshots if i decide to start changing the rest of the look.UPDATE: Removal of top ads etc... minor change...Code tested regarding trailer page, seems to work fine now.... The original trailer was larger then normal, i can see the IMDB have resized their trailers and the problem has gone as a result.`
