@description  This code is meant to hide the follower count that appears on your follower page.  If you want to hide the follower count that appears on the side of your dashboard, this is not the code for you.    NOTE: This code does not remove the names of your followers. I whited out the names for the screenshot. Only the follower count is hidden by this script.
