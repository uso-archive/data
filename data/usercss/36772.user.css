@name           Mozilla Labs -- Simplified
@namespace      USO Archive
@author         mulenmar
@description    `This style is much simpler than my others, as there is very little simplifying to do for the Mozilla Labs website.All it does is replace the bright background image with black color, give the text a good contrast color, shift the RSS links list up a bit on the page, and a few other things to generally improve readability. I dare say that it looks much better than it did already.It's only tested at 1400x1050, but since there is almost no repositioning placement should be as Mozilla intended.Please leave your thoughts, if you have any constructive criticism. ^_^Current version: r003Known issues:r002 (9-12-2010): Does not work with Jetpack page.
