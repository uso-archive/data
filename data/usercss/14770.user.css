@name         Gmail - white buttons

@author       eliah
@description  Recently Gmail changed their buttons to a shiny, pseudo-gradient look. I wanted them to be flat-white instead, so I wrote this style. Downside: the button looks the same when it's clicked as it does when it's not clicked. Doesn't bother me as much as the previous button look, but it's a trade-off.
