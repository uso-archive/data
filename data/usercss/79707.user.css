@description  WordPress allows bloggers to set floating annoyances such as a follow box that normally is a merely annoying tab at the bottom, but on tablets sometimes floats in front of the content. That plus some other annoyances will be addressed here as I run into them. AdBlock probably gets other things, I wouldn't know.
