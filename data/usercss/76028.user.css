@description  Thunderbird: Resize the Calendar Toolbar and the Tasks Toolbar in Thunderbird. Both (which occupy the same position and shape... but exist on different TB tabs) are overly large in my opinion, and thus here is a way to shrink them smaller. You probably won't have a calendar toolbar though unless you have first installed the Lightning addon (calendar).

/* There are five items below that have had their height changed in code... but they only go to
visibly effect the height of one thing... the calendar/task toolbar (only visible under 
calendar/task tabs). You can't just change the height of the toolbar itself, you also have to 
change the height of some of the elements in the toolbar. The first two items are the innermost 
items, the second pair of items contain the innermost items, and the last items "#calendar-
toolbar-deck" is the actual (ie, largest) item we are trying to change. 

REMEMBER: to right-click>CUSTOMIZE the CALENDAR/TASK-TOOLBARS (by clicking on both said 
toolbar(S), and not on the other toolbars) first, and change icon size to small for optimal 
results). */
