@name         HTML - Justify paragraphs by default (beta!)
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       pile0nades
@description  Makes paragraphs justified by default. It looks better IMHO. Screenshots are of http://annevankesteren.nl/ . Note, this code can cause some minor visual bugs in websites, such as when a paragraph is inside a centered div, the paragraph can become uncentered.    Edit: there is a better-working user script at http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/4065 , use that with Greasemonkey instead.
