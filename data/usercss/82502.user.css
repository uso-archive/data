/*
VERY simple script to take back input boxes and make them be black on white

You may change the colors below to whatever you want them to be
and it should work out fine. Make sure, if you want alpha (transprency)
you must enter the code like this rgba(redvalue,bluevalue,greenvalue,alphavalue)
all values would be between 0 and 255 in levels of lightness to that colorplane
or alphaplane. The rest should be self explanitory....
if for some unforseeable reason this isnt, osirisgothra@hotmail.com can help you.
