@name           TeamXbox forum: Dynamic width
@namespace      USO Archive
@author         WataKKo
@description    `With this style, the forum width is restricted by your browser window viewport width, not the set 1000px as per usual.Images will be full-size but restricted to 1024px (instead of 552px) wide(change this if your res. is lower/higer). I couldn't get images to scale dynamically with any resolution. Ideally they should be full-size and downscale if they don't fit the post width. People should really only post, idk, < 500kB 1280x800 screenshots and link to the full-size to make it easier for everyone anyway.Use style 19140 if you want to keep the forums the same, but keep the ability to scale images.`
