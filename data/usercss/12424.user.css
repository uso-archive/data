@description  Sorry if this one hasn't been working for a bit but it's all fixed now :)  Black background with an evil smiley face in the middle >:D    and    somebody got into my bank account and took a bunch of my money :( so if you could be kind enough to donate some money that would be great. Any amount would help :)
