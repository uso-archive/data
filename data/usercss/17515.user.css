@description  On the product page, this style removes the following sections:     - Buy this together with that  - Customers that bought this also bought these  - Tell the publisher you want it on Kindle  - Citations  - Inside this book  - Books on related topics  - User tags  - Sell a Kindle edition  - Customer forums  - Amapedia Community Beta  - Ads for unrelated crap (Looking at computer software? Buy a log splitter!)  - The blue "feedback" box  - The links to other amazon sites at the bottom of the page     The removals are separate, and commented, so if you WANT one of those sections it's pretty easy to remove the part that excludes it.      Note, please, that many of the sections are not explicitly tagged by Amazon, so I had to put in a lot of "start here, then go down three" type selectors. That will likely mean that any Amazon change breaks some parts of this. Also, non-US users may have a different Amazon experience, so I don't know if the same stuff will work for you.

/***********************************************
 *
 * WARNING WARNING WARNING
 *
 * This style uses a lot of "A + B + C" selectors
 * because Amazon doesn't use id's, and they use
 * the same class for nearly everything.
 *
 * Because of this, it is VERY likely that even a 
 * simple change to Amazon will break some of 
 * these rules. 
 * 
 * Please let me know via UserStyles.org if you
 * find a broken rule.
