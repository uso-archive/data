@description  Distraction-free writing in Google Docs - inspired by Hog Bay's WriteRoom. No email, no IM, no web - just writing. It's like a type-writer on your computer, only with online storage, group editing and automatic versioning.    Use this in combination with Full Screen mode in Firefox (View > Full Screen or F11). It hides everything, reduces contrast, and increases text. It sets a maximum width for the text area so it can work well even on very large screens.    Improves on work done in style 9889 by user 13791.    Note that this is still a fairly basic script - it only covers basic paragraph text and headings.    Updated 2009/10/22 For smaller sub-headings
