@name         Dark Mode for whitescreen online

@description  This useful little lightweight webpage makes it super easy to quick put up an all-black screen on one or more monitors, just by clicking the box. However it ironically does not have its own dark mode, and the white background was irritating considering I mostly used the page at night, so I created my own dark mode. The site is MUCH more pleasing to the eyes at night now.  Enjoy!

  UserStyles.org may just be the worst website experience 
  I have experienced in 20 years of online activities.
  9 times out of 10 simple edits to the CSS code throw errors
  when there are no errors in the code. Then the 10th time, w/o
  rewriting any code, the "Save & Publish" button FINALLY works.
  I hope they find some way to get a skilled engineer on board
  that is willing to help at least make the site usable. As it
  sits it is such a waste of years of quality work.
  
  NOTE: If this style does not appear to work in browsers other than Firefox, it is because of the way the site forced the code to have a moz-document header. Chrome and Vivaldi users can just remove the first 2 lines, as well as the opening curly bracket on the 3rd line, and the closing curly bracket on the last line of css code. This was primarily developed and used on Google Chrome/Vivaldi so it should prove to work best in those browsers. Feel free to contact me in comments here or @ShaneX on X.com (Twitter) with any questions or bugs.
