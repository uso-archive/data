@description  Replaced by TV Guide (.co.uk) Minimisation MkIII (Jan 2015)  To permanently hide the side menu - which is intrusive, takes up space and I am always shutting it away!  (This may be too drastic for some - which is why I have separated it from my other style for this site.)  Site reloading does not need the "now" link - right click on the tab instead  Selecting by "genre" I have never used  I have it set to show 9 hours forward so never really need to select any time slot other than "now"  Changing Channel selection - can use the pull down box at the end to just add a channel; if you want to do anything more substantial, just temporarily disable this style
