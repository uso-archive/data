@description  If you color modify gmail in a trivial manner, for instance by enabling Blackify (http://userstyles.org/styles/2154), the result is almost perfect except that there are bright ugly stripes between all of the entries.    This script removes those stripes.  Nothing more, nothing less.  With it, gmail looks smooth when colored by other scripts that did not attend to the stripes.  There is not much visible difference if you're using default colors, but anything with a black background will make this very welcome.    This works with gmail as of March 2009.  (What is elsewhere on this site being called 'gmail2')
