@name         New Yahoo Mail - Full-Width, No Ads, No Crap
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       johnnyzero
@description  This style makes Yahoo Mail page full-width, and hides most of the annoying crap: Yahoo top header, ALL "message list" ads, right-side ad panel, Breaking News, Views, Contacts button, Calendar button, Notepad button, and Yahoo Video nonsense in empty folders.    One minor inconvenience: also hides the Settings button. For those times when you need to access Settings, you can just temporarily disable the style. Or, you could create a Bookmark to the following URL: https://mail.yahoo.com/d/settings/0    Comments & suggestions are welcome.
