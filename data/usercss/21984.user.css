@name         discogs.com - disable max-width (for large screen)

@description  Discogs updated it's layout, so far so good.  They had the terrible idea to put in a fixed-width of about 1000 pixels.  After many complaints, they changed it to a max-width of 1200 pixels.    Very nice, most people don't notice the max-width. But the moment you use a larger screen at a resolution of 1600 to 1920 pixels width, it looks like you're pinched between two walls...    Extra width is very usefull on discogs, as you're sometimes looking at a lot of data.  So here is a small code that disables the max-width:
@version      20091020.15.20
@license      NONE
@preprocessor uso

@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);

@-moz-document domain("discogs.com") {
/*Max-width Fix*/
body {min-width:100%;}
table.discussionsList {width:100%;} 
/*Max-width Fix*/
}
