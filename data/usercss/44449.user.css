@description  Based a lot on The Aeroboy Chrome extension (http://goo.gl/1fBKP), these scrollbars are a slight refinement. Choose between his and mine, I'm not sure how much better or worse mine are! WEBKIT BROWSERS ONLY (Chromium, Safari, ect. - NOT Firefox).    NEW - Mozilla version: style 46044.    Differences to Aeroboy's extension:   - Transparency on all scrollbars except the far outer ones.   - Change of colour on hover and mouse down.   - Thinner.   - Possible other things I have forgotten.    Screenshot notes:   - Them two scrollbars in "after" really are the same colour, it's an optical illusion! Even I (who wrote the code) had to check this in Paint.   - The scrollbar in "before" is from an XP theme I have downloaded (i.e. the system default).   - The screenshots are from this page (the edit page), with style 44215 activated.
