@description  I didn't like the minimalist styles for the AwesomeBar results that removed the title.  So I made my own that just turns the size of the text down and pushes everything a little closer.    edit in response to Alaaddin:  This style was made on Vista...for Vista...and I have been using it since the first public Beta on Windows 7. Just installed it on a new reinstall (less than an hour old) of the release candidate and I am still happy with this style. I suggest you go with a different style or create your own if you do not like mine.    Thank you to those who actually did like the improvements I made.
