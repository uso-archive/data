@name         Google Analytics - Show longer pagenames hack
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       lestarte2008
@description  On the page under https://www.google.com/analytics/reporting/top_content shows a longer table than in the original GA-design, so you can read on first sight most URLs and don't have to guess.    Known issues:  - Cannot give the moz-document url space, since the GA interface URL (ID) is different for every user. So it may(!) apply for more pages on the web.  - Distorts the rest of the design a little bit.  - Has impact on Wikipedia and GMX too, sadly. They use the same div-names. Just deactivate the style, when not using GA.
