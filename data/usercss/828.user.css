@description    `This is a very simple style mod that removes all of the top, side, and bottom ads/bannersfrom newegg.com, giving more screen real estate for browsing items, etc.  Now--of course, theremay be a few "hot deals" in those ad banners that you'll miss out on...but I've never foundany.  This is probably not a very useful style, but there's a few people who may appreciate it.I also use adblock+, so keep that in mind if you still see ads.`
