@description    `This will cause the forum to stretch to the full width of your browser window. If this is too big I’ve also done a 90% and 75%.If you want a different width, just edit the style through Stylus and change the percentage, it is very easy!This can be installed along with one of the Declutter styles.NOTE: MSE are changing the forum quite a lot at the moment so expect this style to break if they do anything. If something seems wrong please disable all styles first to check.`
