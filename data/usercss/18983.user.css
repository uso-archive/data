@name         Thinkwell Exercises - Black on White
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       orngjce223
@description  Affects http://thinkwell.com/ products: turns the exercises (both fill-out and printable versions) into white-on-black rather than black-on-white.  I can't do anything for the images, sorry :(    PS. Presumably simple enough to be in the public domain, but just in case someone thinks it doesn't already end up there - this script is released into the public domain.
