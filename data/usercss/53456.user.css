@description  Features:    "URL preview compatability" -  The URL preview bar that shows and hides depending on if your cursor is hovering over a link in Firefox and Chrome usually covers the 4chan X Image Hover. This places a 20 px space where the image can't go so that it can never be covered by it.  "Keep on top" -  Changes the z-index of the 4chan X Image hover so that elements in other userstyles like navigation bars and quick reply windows don't cover it up.  "Fit to screen width and height" -  Keeps images from 4chan X Image Hover limited to the size of your screen so that larges images don't go off the screen.
