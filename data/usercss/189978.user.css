@description  A simple theme that hides the comments section, "related videos" panel, the home page, and the trending page for YouTube. Good for avoiding distractions when you have to use YouTube for school or work.    The search option is not disabled so you can still search for videos as needed. Also, it can easily be switched on and off to disable and re-enable these features without having to refresh the page.
