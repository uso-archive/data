@name         Firefox 4: Bookmarks Toolbar above tabs, enhanced
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       wyrenth
@description  This CSS enhances Tynstar's useful "Bookmarks Toolbar above tabs" by adding options for background color and opacity, text color to help stand out against different window colors, and padding to keep things looking neither crunched together nor spaced apart wastefully.    Note, slight issue with padding: Clicking an item in the toolbar seems to bump objects to the right of it around slightly. If this bothers you, you can remark out the padding code. If anyone has a fix, lemme know. :) I'm hardly a CSS wiz.    Apr 29, 2014 - IMPORTANT: This userstyle is no longer compatible as of Firefox v29.0 (it colors the bar, but does not move the bar up, will try and figure out how to fix this later).
