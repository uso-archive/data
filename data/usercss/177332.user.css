@description  DON'T INSTALL => DDG changed its "Content Security Policy directive" and now it refuses to load files loaded outside its domain. The solution would be to have the reimu pics directly hosted by ddg but I don't know how I could do that. Sorry...     For users who prefer to be greeted by a cute girl rather than a dumb duck.  Only changes are the front page/search bar logo.  ---  ☆*:.｡.o(≧▽≦)o.｡.:*☆    (Original drawing by Yuuka Nonoko)  (Original concept by Siss-Sama : https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/2867-satorinsatoringo )
