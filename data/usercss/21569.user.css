@name           Twitter - Show Private-Tweet Locks in FF2

@description    `Recently, Twitter's private-tweet lock image disappeared to me. It took a while to figure out what was wrong, but I tracked it down to the CSS 'inline-block' display property... which does not work in versions below Firefox 3.For those of you who are either unable or unwilling to update Firefox for whatever reasons (for me, it's an unwillingness to let go of an extension that isn't available for version 3), this may be of use. It restores the private-tweet lock icon. Of course, it has no effect on public tweets.Not very useful for anyone else, unfortunately; and I have no clue whether it works in versions other than Firefox 2.Credit goes to the following site (found through Google) for helping me figure out how to fix the issue: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/display.html#inlineblock`
