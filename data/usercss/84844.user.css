@description  This style makes the text in workflowy bold and monospace. It also removes the horizontal scrollbar.    Within workflowy's settings, I personally use this with the "Wood" theme and "Light" font.    Why do I use "Light" font, not Wood's "Typewriter" font, which is also monospace?    I like "Typewriter", but it isn't that visible on the iPhone, where I have no way to bold it. So I use the "Light" font on iPhone, but that switches the font on the web app too to "Light" too, which I don't want. So I created this theme because it gives you the option to have a different font selected on your iPhone or iPad than you see in your web app.
