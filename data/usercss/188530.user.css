@description  Removes video suggestions on Youtube homepage, along with the "Suggested videos" column from your Youtube page - helping to prevent you going down those pesky Youtube rabbitholes until 3am.     Search bar remains functional, along with redirects to specific videos from other websites. This means you can still watch videos for research/education, but simply won't have the tempting recommendations for other videos.    Just toggle on and off in stylish extension for easy access.    Works with other styles active simultaneously.
