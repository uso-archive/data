@name         Pedelecs Forum - Makes links blue

@author       10mph
@description  The board default has now been altered by its admin to make links standout better, So I have removed the make link blue feature.  I have  expanded the width to occupy the space formerly occupied by the advertising banners in the right hand column. The Advertising banners now appear displaced below the main forum box.
