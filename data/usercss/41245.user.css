@description  With the release of Heroes of Newerth 2.0, S2 gave the community the ability to buy avatars, different name colors and icons. I liked the old "cleaner" look better, so I threw together a mod to remove the following:    "Diamond" name colors  Avatars bought in the shop  Icons bought in the shop    Update 1.03:    Fixed for the "new" layout on the forums.    Update 1.02:    Now also removes "silver" namecolor bought in the shop.    Update 1.01:     I removed the signature removal, since it is possible from the user control panel.
