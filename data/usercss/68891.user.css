@description  Install this for an Eridan-themed tumblr dashboard!  8D    I also made some notes identifying which section corresponds to which part of the dashboard so anyone who wanted to change anything could do so fairly easily.

Hi everyone!
I just started learning CSS yesterday, so this isn't an incredibly fancy theme, or anything.  However, I did label each section for anyone new to CSS (or a pro who just doesn't want to write a new code) who'd like to use this as a template to make their own themes without having to test what each thing does!

All you really have to do to change this theme around is edit the hex and rgba codes and replace any images.  I'm assuming you can at least identify these three things when they show up in the code (images are pretty obvious: they're urls).  If you don't know what hex or rgba codes are, it's easy to look them up, and they're pretty simple.
So yeah, just change the colors or images!  You can also change or remove other things within each section, if you'd like (although in that case I'd suggest at least an extremely basic understanding of stuff).  But even if you aren't entirely sure of what you're doing, CSS is pretty easy and most things are exactly what you'd think they would be!

Anything between these (without the spaces) / * inserttexthere * / has no effect on the code, so that's how you can identify any labels or small comments I've made!  And of course, feel free to add your own for future reference!

I hope you guys like this theme or at least are able to get some use out of it to change it as you please!  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to send me an ask on tumblr! :>
