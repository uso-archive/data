@description    `Some pictures of Cherry from the band Studio Killers, used to replace Tumblr's default new post icons (text, photo, etc.)btw, if you notice, each picture is themed with the type of post it represents. The Studio Killers logo (made up of typographic text) for text post; a design from one of the official Studio Killers t-shirts for the photo post; a screenshot from the "All Men Are Pigs" MV for quote post, since in the song Cherry quotes what men say to women to get them to trust them; Cherry and Jenny from the official "Jenny" single artwork for link post, since Cherry has a link to Jenny and feels connected to her with love; Cherry from "Ode to the Bouncer" for chat post, since in the song Cherry has a chat with the Bouncer, trying to get him to let her into the club; a screenshot from "Eros and Apollo" for audio post, just because it's a song >.>; and finally Cherry in the short video "All About You" for video post, because it is just a video and not a music video.`
