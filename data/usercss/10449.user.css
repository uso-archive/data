@description  credits go out to:    - style 799 - this style started out with thespook's style. Sadly, he never came around to update his style for deviantArt v6.  - http://boffinbrain.deviantart.com/ - I used his toolbar icons. I hope he'll make icons for all of the new v6 icons aswell  - http://asmodiel.deviantart.com/ - I used some of his emoticons    This is a complete redesign of deviantart v6. All pages should be covered - at least all that I use and have seen.    I do however also use deviantTIDY:    http://boffinbrain.deviantart.com/art/deviantTIDY-45622809    I encourage everyone to use this as style or extension as it makes deviantart better.    style style 906 is also a nice addition to this style.    PLEASE NOTICE THAT THIS STYLE IS SEVERAL SIZES TOO BIG FOR USERSTYLES.ORG AND I DO NOT LIKE  LINKING TO PICTURES ON SOME WEBSPACE. TO INSTALL IT YOU HAVE TO GRAB THE .CSS FROM HERE:    http://www.filesavr.com/devartv6smokinorange      Here are some full-size screenshots:    http://www.filesavr.com/screenshot1  http://www.filesavr.com/screenshot2  http://www.filesavr.com/screenshot3    UPDATES:    9/12: seems like I forgot the message center and notices section .. probably because no one ever sent me a message on deviantart :P it's all fixed now. Please grab the new .css   9/13: fixed all settings/profile pages, folder view gallery pages. Many other smaller fixes. As always, grab the new css pls.
