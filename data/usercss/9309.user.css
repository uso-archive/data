@name           Fast Dial v1.x  only - Transparency with Hover

@description    `This style is essentially the same ashttp://userstyles.org/styles/8812except it has the added option to alter opacity again on hover.This Style allows you, should you so wish it, to alter the transparency/opacity of all the cells you have in Fast Dial.If you look at the code, you will see that it allows you to change the transparency of the Dialing Cells (created by "Add to Fast Dial"),  separately from  the non-dialing cells, which are usually attached to a Group. This means  you for example that you could have all dialing cells with a transparency of 0.9 and all non-dialing cells completely transparent. The choice is of course entirely yours.f you set the Opacity value to 0.0 (zero) then the cell will become  completely Transparent.If you set the Opacity to 1.0 (One) it will have no Transparency at all.(The values in between are  0.1 to 0.9 ) With this added option to change Opacity on Hover, you can have two different settings, one for normal use and one for hover.Not to be confused with Transparent Logos which are explained here:http://userlogos.org/node/461This opacity fix will unfortunately not resolve Transparency difficulties with Transparent Logos encountered in FD 1.x  when using FF2.If you are successfully using Transparent  Logos in FD 1.x  in FF3 it is possible  that your interest in opacity may be limited to dialing cells.Pictures below(opacity 0.3)---->----(opacity 0.6 on hover)`
