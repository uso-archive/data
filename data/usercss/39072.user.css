@name         Gmail - Unobtrusive Labels
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       cfc
@description  Tired of labels in Gmail taking too much space away from the subject lines in your inbox, but don't want to hide them completely? This style shrinks labels down to a large bullet, and expands them on mouseover. As long as you color code your labels, this lets you clearly mark different kinds of messages without taking up a lot of screen real estate.
