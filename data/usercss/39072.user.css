@name           Gmail - Unobtrusive Labels
@namespace      USO Archive
@author         cfc
@description    `Tired of labels in Gmail taking too much space away from the subject lines in your inbox, but don't want to hide them completely? This style shrinks labels down to a large bullet, and expands them on mouseover. As long as you color code your labels, this lets you clearly mark different kinds of messages without taking up a lot of screen real estate.`
