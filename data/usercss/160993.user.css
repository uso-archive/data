@name           Fallen London - ConflictCard Echos & Hidden Favour
@namespace      USO Archive
@author         Corran
@description    `This style adds the echo value of the options on the Faction Conflict Cards. It also adds what will be gained that can't be expressed in echos: menace changes, second chances, bundles, etc.It also adds the echo value for all the Call in favours storylets, even though they are all the same.Finally, it also adds a reminder to card options that give a favour when this is not communicated via the text on the card (like the The Heron Tower card).This style works with the June 2018 redesign.`
