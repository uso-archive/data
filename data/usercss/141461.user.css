1. Grab the item's url! For example algae's is: http://www.goatlings.com/images/items/Algae.gif
2. Take out the "http://www.goatlings.com" part! Now it should be just: /images/items/Algae.gif
3. Copy and paste that part into this:
----------------------------
img[src="Paste it here!!"]
{
 opacity: 0; 
}
----------------------------
4. Copy that sweet new code somewhere below the } down there vv
