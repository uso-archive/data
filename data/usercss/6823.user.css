@description    `Highlights pinned posts in blue like Bloglines classic.2008/08/08 - Items on the start page don't look as good with the blue highlighting since the redesign. I'll see what I can do, but I might wait to see if they make any further changes as there are some things they will definitely have to fix (like the fact that the title isn't a link) so I'm expecting more changes soon.----Subscribe to my blog to be informed about new Bloglines Beta Enhancements:http://bloglines-beta.blogspot.com/If you use the save feature of Bloglines Beta, and have GreaseMonkey installed you may be interested in my Sort Save to Folder options script: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/48185`
