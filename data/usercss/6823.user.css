@description  Highlights pinned posts in blue like Bloglines classic.    2008/08/08 - Items on the start page don't look as good with the blue highlighting since the redesign. I'll see what I can do, but I might wait to see if they make any further changes as there are some things they will definitely have to fix (like the fact that the title isn't a link) so I'm expecting more changes soon.    ----  Subscribe to my blog to be informed about new Bloglines Beta Enhancements:  http://bloglines-beta.blogspot.com/    If you use the save feature of Bloglines Beta, and have GreaseMonkey installed you may be interested in my Sort Save to Folder options script: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/48185
