@description  The current link styles, in articles, on The Register, use red (#D60000)  and a slightly darker red (#A80000) for the colour of a link and a visited  link respectively. This makes it difficult to discern between unfollowed  and followed links. This style overrides those colours and uses the  standard blue (#0000EE) and purple (#551A8B) colours instead.
