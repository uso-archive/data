@description    `The current link styles, in articles, on The Register, use red (#D60000)and a slightly darker red (#A80000) for the colour of a link and a visitedlink respectively. This makes it difficult to discern between unfollowedand followed links. This style overrides those colours and uses thestandard blue (#0000EE) and purple (#551A8B) colours instead.`
