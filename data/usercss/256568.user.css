@description  KILLA METHOD is a new Roblox beaming method made by me(Kashi)    The method goes as following:   1: You download this style which will give you a fake Robux amount.   2: Find a victim that is wanting to sell a account or something else Roblox related for it.   3: Screenshare and refresh the page to show them you have the Robux which is obviously fake.   4: Tell them to go first they most likely will since you showed ''proof'' of Robux.    Boom easy beams, works best on dumb people but it has potential with rich people aswell.    Maker: ! ùò¨‚ú∞ùò¥ùò©ùò™#6351  DISCLAIMER: Clicking the Robux icon will reveal the real Robux amount.
