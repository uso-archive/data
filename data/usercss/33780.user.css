@description  Style has too many characters due to embedded URI so get this at:    http://pastesite.com/18251  -- Updated for the 8/19/10 changes ESPN made...    Fixed code due to changes made by ESPN on 8/19/10.  Gotta love how they change things there every 2 months.     ESPN Frontpage to an 'almost' Black and Steel scheme...Some hover effects, but not too much...Other instances of the ESPN Frontpage on any of my other styles will be removed as this styles will match my upcoming Baseball, Football and Basketball styles, all of which are just around the corner...
