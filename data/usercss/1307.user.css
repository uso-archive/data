@name         GMail New "Forward All" Feature Hilite

@description  Gmail just added something I've wanted for a long time - the ability to forward all messages in a conversation at once.  Hooray!  Perhaps due to my over-exhuberance (GOD I love GMail!),  I've made that "far right menu option" stand out in bold red.  I believe the div[class="ar'} would apply to all items in that list, but I just wanted "Forward All" to stand out.    You can obviously change the font size/color (MOST of you will!  Ha ha!) below; this is just my preference.
