@name         Block Animated Favicons

@description  Disable the annoying animated favicons that appear on certain websites.    What does it do? (Features):  - Removes animated fav icons from the URLBar (left of the awesome bar) where the site identity button is  - Prevents animated icons in the awesome bar list  - Prevents animated favicons from becoming your bookmarks icons (either in bookmarks toolbar OR bookmarks menu)  - Prevents animated favicons from appearing in your Back / Forward history menus  - This style ONLY blocks animated (GIF) favicons... Don't worry, this style will not ruin your website viewing experience, it will make it better!      These can be very distracting and idiotic.    ** This code was taken from Lifehacker, which was taken from The How-To Geek (http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/lifehacker/full/~3/365590909/how-to-block-distracting-animated-favicons)    TEST THIS STYLE HERE:  http://dhl-usa.com/home/home.asp    ** You may need to Refresh the Page and/or reset your browser for this to work.    Remove Annoyances!    Integrated Styles:  + Try out Style 9729 to make YOUR OWN animated favicon on a loading tab!    Call for help:  Try this website: http://favicons.pouessel.org/frame.html    Everything is working fine, except for the bookmarking.  If you bookmark this page, it will display an animation... I tried to code a block for it, but It would not block, any help would be great!    Changelog:  1.0.0.4:  + BUGFIX: Site identity for sites that change the name of the .gif now fixed.    1.0.0.3:  + BUGFIX: Above, I mentioned that you can rename a .gif to .ico and it will still animate and not be blocked.  Well, I managed to hack in a way to check if it has been renamed, and this update will prevent those types of favicons (looks at content type).  - Test this update here (http://favicons.pouessel.org/frame.html)  = Expect one more update soon, that will do the same, but for the site-identity button.    1.0.0.2:  + BUGFIX: There was a bug where the icon shows up in the tab's favicon (tab bar) - now NO animated favicons of websites show up on any part of the browser!    1.0.0.1:  + Now working perfectly, thanks to user 13489's Fix (will be global style now).  + Moved out of obsolete mode, now that the style is working
