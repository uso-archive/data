@description    `made for: reference.sitepoint.com\cssThis style is meant for stylish authors and for web-based CSS development applications such as web hosting applications that run inside your browser. It is mainly useful within a sidebar such as Firefox's, which can be set as an option when you modify a previously created favorite (aka bookmark, hot-list item, etc).`

/*
   reference.sitepoint.com - sidebar friendly CSS for quick-reference usage

   version 1.0 (preliminary release, please see below)

   written by Gabriel Thomas Sharp

   !important: PLEASE TURN OFF WORD-WRAP FOR BEST READING EXPERIENCE :!important

   see all my other userstyles available for stylish on:

      http://paradisim.zxq.net                                            (Paradisim L.L.C., Homepage)

   or directly at:

      http://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_terms=osirisgothra       (userstyles.org Homepage)

   makes Sitepoint's css reference sidebar friendly making it nice
   to use when writing user styles. This is also good for other web
   based development tools.

   recommend you bookmark on sidebar from this page:
   http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/layout

   note that if you bookmark from the main css page, it wont display
   right because it wasn't meant to be used with this style. also,
   other parts of the sitepoint site are untested and are not supported
   by this style, so please don't complain about those unless you have
   some great idea on how to easily extend support to it!

   this is a preliminary release of this style, it has many issues
   but should work for a 400px width sidebar, good for 1280x1024 
   desktops-- if you have insight on any of these issues feel more
   than free to email me at osirisgothra@hotmail.com and I will give
   you credit wherever you have helped me out on the next release.


   if you are looking for general ad-blocking, there are already some
   good ad-blocking styles on userstyles.org, this is strictly meant
   for use as a sidebar app.
