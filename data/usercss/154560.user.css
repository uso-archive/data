@name         BitBucket PR sticky headers
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       JBA
@description  This makes the pull request header and file headers sticky.  This allows you to always see the current PR status and have access to PR actions such as approving without having to scroll up.  The file header lets you see which file you're in (not always clear when scrolling through large diffs) and perform actions such as ignoring whitespace.    Requires that the browser has support for "position: sticky"
