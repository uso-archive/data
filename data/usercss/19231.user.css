@name         AwesomeBar - Use a monospaced font

@author       Samat
@description  Set a Monospace font for Firefox's URL bar/Awesome bar. While a monospace font displays less of a URL, it can also make it easier to edit a URL.    If you know CSS, change "monospace" to a font installed on your system to use a different font.    This is actually included as an example in Firefox's userChrome-example.css, but not many people know about it.
