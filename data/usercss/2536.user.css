@description  This style tweaks the BetterSearch "preview" box.  It changes:    1) the margin color  2) the border size and color  3) width and height    The width and height are set for the search results (indented and unindented) as seen on a resolution of 1680x1050.  I might suggest that you play around with these values to better suit your needs, especially if you have a screen resolution different from that.    I might suggest that you apply this in combination with one of my other styles style 2535, which does not break this style's layout.    (06-23-07 - Updated to include topic specific Google search results: Linux, BSD, & microsoft)  (03-08-08 - Updated to include the inexplicable addition of the "http://www.l.google.com" domain)  (09-02-08 - Updated to a resolution of 1680x1050 and to reflect change in Google code)  (09-10-08 - Updated code to improve improve implementation)
