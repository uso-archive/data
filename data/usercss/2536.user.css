@description    `This style tweaks the BetterSearch "preview" box.  It changes:1) the margin color2) the border size and color3) width and heightThe width and height are set for the search results (indented and unindented) as seen on a resolution of 1680x1050.  I might suggest that you play around with these values to better suit your needs, especially if you have a screen resolution different from that.I might suggest that you apply this in combination with one of my other styles style 2535, which does not break this style's layout.(06-23-07 - Updated to include topic specific Google search results: Linux, BSD, & microsoft)(03-08-08 - Updated to include the inexplicable addition of the "http://www.l.google.com" domain)(09-02-08 - Updated to a resolution of 1680x1050 and to reflect change in Google code)(09-10-08 - Updated code to improve improve implementation)`
