Some of us aren't members of MySpace, and will never be. MySpace BandView hides those parts of the site that aren't useful to us, and tidies a few things up.

Here's what it does:
1) Hides the background image - makes for faster scrolling
2) Hides the contact table
3) Hides the friends list
4) Hides the friend comments
5) Makes some of the text bigger* (when the default is too small)

*: I'd like some help to get this working better. 
The following is either too small, or irregulary sized:
General Info: Band Website, Band Members, Influences, Sounds Like
Upcoming Shows: heading, "view all" link, venues.

To do at some point:
Fix text sizes (see above)
Widen page (left and right margins are rather large.
Make links stand out a bit (not always easy to tell from text).
Make section headers smaller.

If you're interested in blocking ads or flash, look up the Firefox plugins "AdBlock" and "NoScript".
