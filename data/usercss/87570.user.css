@description  Disables the youtube chat.    Reason:  You may want to prevent yourself from spoilers concerning tv-shows and movies, also prevents you from seeing overall stupidity and anonimity around that place.    Why it's useful:  Using this style will prevent you from being spoiler'ed by comments. Some users even use comments like "spoilers below, beware!", so why not prevent yourself from seeing them altogether?
