@description  Because AO3's stats coding could be more user friendly, with some basic link colour fudging this style "hides" anything that is a hyperlink on the stats line of a work on the AO3 tags page (comments, kudos, bookmarks, and unfortunately also collection). In addition, this style also hides the stats line completely on the work's page as well as the block of uses who have given kudos at the bottom of a work, as well as hides the numbers on any user's works page.
