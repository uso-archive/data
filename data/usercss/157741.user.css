@description  Folds the Discord Channels panel, reducing it's width. When hovered over the channels expand back to normal size. Makes it easier to use the web version in a smaller window.    Update (17/10/2019) - rename `channels` to `sidebar` as discord have changed their tag    Update (10/07/2018) - now using better CSS element selectors that should keep it working whenever Discord deploys a new build.
