@description  This user style resizes the video player element in YouTube in order to achieve unscaled viewing for 720p videos. I wrote it because of my frustration every time I watched screencast videos, where the scaling (either downscaling in windowed mode or upscaling when in fullscreen mode) causes text and UI elements in the screencasts to appear much blurrier than they really are.    With this style, the recorded video frame and the displayed frame have exactly the same dimensions, much like the effect of e.g. Vimeo's "Scaling On/Off" button. So, say "goodbye" to blurriness and say "hello" to a crisp, sharp picture for those interesting tutorial screencasts! For optimal user experience, it is obvious that you should have your monitor set to a resolution big enough to accommodate the resized video player.
