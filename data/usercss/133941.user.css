@description  Focus Mode: only the game, but everything else still available when you mouse over it.  Also, always centered on your browser window. This makes it easier to adjust the window when you are doing other things on screen while playing.  Made for 8 Ball Pool. Works on some other games.  Simple code, easy to adjust settings.  Side ads removed -- if you don't have it already use uBlock Origin or AdBlock Plus, etc.
