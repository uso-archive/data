@description  An update to this theme! picture now shows the image in the search results. However everything but text and pictures are transparent so be ware it may be hard to read. I also added support for www.google.com/?safe=active&ssui=on on on Chromebooks!  A Google theme for Furries. Not complete yet as I'm trying to figure out how to change the logo  when you are is the results screen. I'm also gonna resize the photo too so it fits the whole photo (Currently resizing the photo makes it more blurry).  Image in search screen was made by AotoAka and can be found here: https://www.furaffinity.net/full/23712234/  Logo was made by Snow Fangs I think? https://userstyles.org/users/329223  But I made the background of the logo transparent  I used Google Search Custom Background Image by Cruse_Car to make this theme.  If Logo does not appear let me know.  There is a bug that causes the logo to appear in signed out accounts profile images, I'll need to find out how to fix that otherwise its a minor bug.
