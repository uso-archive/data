@description    `<mark><b>Important: Click the "Show CSS Code" button first. The install button will work after that. I highly recommend this <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/147056/">style</a> that makes the "Show CSS Code" button much easier to find.</b></mark> ― This style will remove things I barely use when trying to organize my albums. I usually organize them by date of updates and I think I'm not the only one here. So to speed things up a bit, everything else in the drop-down menu has been hidden.`
