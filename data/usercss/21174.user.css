@description    `When the Ghostery Firefox extension detects an analytic web bug, the popup it displays will be transparent, allowing you to see the web content behind it.  The popup will then return back to normal display when you Hover your Mouse over the popup!The popup's original functionality will remain; clicking the popup will dismiss it.Obviously, you must have the Firefox Add-on "Ghostery" installed (installer link below)* An original style, but I wish to say Thanks to user 6431 for introducing me into the realm of Transparency with style 6771You can Customize the amount of transparency by editing the Opacity in the code (Closer to 0 is closer to invisible, whereas closer to 1 is closer to fully-visible - EXAMPLE: 0.5 is in the middle of opacity)  Currently, the code has it at .6 see-thru (which means it is 40% transparent and 60% opaque)This makes your Ghostery detections easier to see behind, allowing you to view all the web page content without moving your mouse, blocking the text or images!Applies to:+ Transparency on your on screen notification area for each web site's Ghostery Popup (Google Analytics, Omniture, Adsense... Any web bug logging site - be it ad networks, data collectors or analytic providers)+ This is an "Until Hovered Over" style, meaning that the popup will be transparent until you hover your mouse over it, it will then turn opaque and allow you to see the contents easier.Additional Information:* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.+ This style is FULLY customizable, and you can set the transparency to be almost invisible, almost opaque or anything in between!Browser Versions:+ Works on Firefox 3+ Works on Firefox 2Integrates with the following Styles:+ Style 9895** Must have the Ghostery installed on Firefox ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9609 )Changelog:+ Initial public release`
