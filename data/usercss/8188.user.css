@description    `Hover your mouse over an image, and it will display in its full size.  This only works for images that have been resized in code (example: The preview images of Styles on UserStyles)** Thanks goes to user 16 for the Image Resize idea, which is used in the style 127.  I made the code work on Width and Height as well, not just Max-width and Max-Height!!Try it out!Once you install the Style, head over to the page: Style 7875 and give it a try... Cool hey?Functions:- When you hover your mouse over an image that has been resized, it will display normally.Applies to:- Any image that has been resized by code- max-width, preventing a full-width image- max-height, preventing a full-height image+ Just hover your mouse cursor over the image, and it will appear in it's original state (100% size, as if you were to save it to your disk.)Browser Versions:- Works on Firefox 2- Works on Firefox 3Additional Information:+ This style works PERFECTLY on Userstyles.org for the Image Previews of the Styles!+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes!  It has worked perfectly on each.Extension Compatability:** For those of you using the Firefox Extension "Image Zoom" please comment or remove the following lines in the code:    height: auto !important;  width: auto !important;Thanks!Changelog:1.0.0.4:+ Code Cleanup, making it function better+ Added Animated After Image - Use Firefox 3 to view the animation.1.0.0.3:+ Added support for Chrome:// (web pages inside Firefox's configuration) - now works on Extensions such as Brief.+ Added support for FTP sites.1.0.0.2:+ Added support for Local Files (html files located on local computer hard drive)1.0.0.1:+ Fixed Bug where images that Firefox resized were reacting to the hover sizing.+ Thanks goes Entirely to user User 347 for reporting the problem, AND producing a fix.
