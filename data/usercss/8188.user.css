@description  Hover your mouse over an image, and it will display in its full size.  This only works for images that have been resized in code (example: The preview images of Styles on UserStyles)    ** Thanks goes to user 16 for the Image Resize idea, which is used in the style 127.  I made the code work on Width and Height as well, not just Max-width and Max-Height!!    Try it out!  Once you install the Style, head over to the page: Style 7875 and give it a try... Cool hey?    Functions:  - When you hover your mouse over an image that has been resized, it will display normally.    Applies to:  - Any image that has been resized by code  - max-width, preventing a full-width image  - max-height, preventing a full-height image  + Just hover your mouse cursor over the image, and it will appear in it's original state (100% size, as if you were to save it to your disk.)    Browser Versions:  - Works on Firefox 2  - Works on Firefox 3    Additional Information:  + This style works PERFECTLY on Userstyles.org for the Image Previews of the Styles!  + This style has been tested on Multiple Themes!  It has worked perfectly on each.    Extension Compatability:  ** For those of you using the Firefox Extension "Image Zoom" please comment or remove the following lines in the code:      height: auto !important;    width: auto !important;  Thanks!    Changelog:  1.0.0.4:  + Code Cleanup, making it function better  + Added Animated After Image - Use Firefox 3 to view the animation.    1.0.0.3:  + Added support for Chrome:// (web pages inside Firefox's configuration) - now works on Extensions such as Brief.  + Added support for FTP sites.    1.0.0.2:  + Added support for Local Files (html files located on local computer hard drive)    1.0.0.1:  + Fixed Bug where images that Firefox resized were reacting to the hover sizing.  + Thanks goes Entirely to user User 347 for reporting the problem, AND producing a fix.  (This update fix was all myf's code)  I thank you for the code, myf, and continual support of my styles.
