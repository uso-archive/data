@description    `Better highlights the currently <b>selected</b> message.Reactivates the hightlight of the currently focused (when you navigate in the list without selecting) message.Please remember that the current message (navigating with Up and Down, for example) is <b>always</b> selected <b>and</b> focused.You really don't need to use TT DeepDark to use this. But the changes may or may not be visible or pleasant, according to your current theme.`
