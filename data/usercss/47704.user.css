@name         about:addons - Hide Compatibility and "Publish to"
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       ssokolow
@description  Hides the buttons from the Add-on Compatibility Reporter and Add-on Collector extensions so they don't crowd out the description.    They're rarely used anyway, still accessible from the add-on details pages, and it's easy to temporarily turn Stylish off for batch operations.    (It also removes them from places where they're useless, like the Stylish and Greasemonkey tabs)
