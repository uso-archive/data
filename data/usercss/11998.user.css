@description  Last fm (lastFM) user navigation menus will be transparent.    This style improves page visibility, allowing you to see all the web content behind the transparency.    * Thanks to user 1386 for the style 10306, upon which I got the idea for this style!      Features:  + User Name (Username) selection menus (Home, Profile, Recommended, Library, Events, Settings) will be transparent.  + Menus will become more opaque when they are hovered over with the mouse cursor  + You will be able to see images and text behind the header menu (see thru) until hovered over    Works on both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3  Also works with the Painted Black built-in LastFM Style    Integrates with the following Styles:  Style 11529  Style 11902    Last.FM nav menus are also known as badger dropdown lists, and consist of UL (unordered list) code segments  Edit the Transparency (-moz-opacity) to your liking.  Remember, the closer to 0 you get, the more invisible translucent the menu will be, the closer to 1 you get, the more opaque!   1 is 100% opaque, and web content will not show through, 0 is 0% opaque, and will appear as if the menu is hidden!  BenOnUserstyles    Changelog:  1.0.0.1:  + Added a new menu (global song / user options menu).  This menu appears near song tracks and looks like a small cog gear.  It allows you to view certain options such as view song, view album, listen to song...  + Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.
