@description  Compresses the Status Bar.  Removes the padding that makes the statusbar larger on some themes.  This Style is mainly for Firefox 2, but it also works on Firefox 3 (You might not notice, though, because the default theme on Fx3 is already squished, but if you install another one, you will notice)    * Thanks user 3934 for style 3579    Increases editable screen size, allowing you to view and navigate more on websites      Browser Versions:  - Works on Firefox 2  - Works on Firefox 3 (Use large themes and see the difference.)    Integrates with Style 7908    About:Screenshots:  - On my Browser (Fx2) I saved myself 6 whole pixels of screen real-estate.  That is quite a lot.      Changelog:  - Initial Release
