@description  Dataface is an excellent PHP Application Framework for MySQL. It allows one to design an entire application by use of tiny INI files. If a programmer wants more features and complexity, they can begin to delve into the very powerful Dataface API, Triggers, Delegate Classes and many other options. Dataface has excellent Documentation as well. In order to print them easily, without a lot of headers and such, maximizing space on the page for content, I designed this style.    Enjoy.  Thank you kindly.
