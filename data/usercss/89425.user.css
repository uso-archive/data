@description  On all websites, change the width of tab characters in code from the default 8 spaces wide to 4 spaces wide, or whatever other size you choose in the selector below. The setting affects all HTML <tt><code>&lt;code&gt;</code></tt> elements.    This is like my other style <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/70979/github-better-sized-tabs-in-code">GitHub: better-sized tabs in code</a>, but it applies to all websites. However, it only works on properly marked-up code.    This style may not work on some sites that present their code in an unusual way, such as within <code>pre</code> blocks that are not marked as <code>code</code>. If you want to force <code>pre</code> elements to use this tab size even if they are not code, add “<code>pre,</code>” before “<code>code {</code>” in the CSS.
