@description  Wikipedia : Delete the languages you don't understand anyway.  If you're like me, you only know four languages, so the others in wikipedia's list are useless to you.  This stylesheet deletes them.  --  Version 1.03 works on all wikimedia projects and anything else that runs on the mediawiki.  Version 1.04 bugfix: The box is now only as long as needed to fit the languages you added.  Version 1.05 bugfix of 1.04; and marginal simplification of code, using the "not()" pseudo selector. users don't need to fill in pixel values anymore.  (PS: this sheet is now one year old.  :D )  Version 1.06: Using display instead of visibility. (Does not affect result.)    --  @user 16425 (again): Ok, I'm using display:none now. (v1.06) Which is what is should be using , not because it's shorter, but because it removes instead of hide, which is what I'm doing.  @user 16425: No, I wouldn't want that, So I made it in a separate sheet: style 12128 fades instead of deleting.  @user 16425: I did not know about the not() pseudoselector. I'm using it in v1.05 ; Thanks a million.  @user 14957: This is now implemented in version 1.04 and higher. (I knew about this, but didn't know anyone cared)  --  Ratings and comments are very welcome.
