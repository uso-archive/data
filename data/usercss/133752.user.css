@description    `It's always 9+. Facebook, stop teasing me with your little red icon. That "9+" doesn't even represent any information. The only person that number would be meaningful to is someone who only had a handful of friends, because they might actually ever see ALL of their new posts. Ridiculous.This userstyle makes that go awaaaay!(Pairs nicely with <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/127266/facebook-post-interlude">Post interlude</a>, which reminds you periodically to stop scrolling.)Note that Firefox is the only mobile browser I know of with userstyle support!`
