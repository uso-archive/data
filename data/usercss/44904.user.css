@description  Move the Main Reply button to the same level as the "Reply" (with Quote) button  Also moved sufficiently to the left so that the existing Reply (and Edit and Delete) buttons are not obscured  (The Start New Topic Button has to move as well because in Stylish I cannot distinguish them)
