@description    `You ever happened to urgently need a fast solution to a problem, search on Google, click a link - and again you were on a page of ExpertsExchange, exactly describing your problem - but not giving an answer? Instead they tell you, you *would* have found it here if you paid? Never again. Ads gone, solution shown :-)And as for the comment of Scriptuser below: I recommend to try it on more than one page before rating it 0. I use it in exactly that combination (Firefox 3 on Windows XP), and it works fine. Admitted, in some rare cases it fails (one out of 20 - meaning I didn't visit more than 20 pages yet, but it failed only once). If you encounter such a case, instead of rating 0 rather let me know so I can possibly do some thing about it.`
