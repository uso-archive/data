@name         23hq - Distinguish visited vs. non-visited links
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Dan Dascalescu
@description  If you're annoyed that the 23 forums choose to render normal links the same as visited links, this user style will fix that.    Visited link SHOULD look differently from non-visited links, to help you tell where you've been already.
