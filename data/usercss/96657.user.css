@description    `This script modifies websites and UI elements I've run into that don't match whatever color scheme you're running in KDE. It makes the websites that somehow become unreadable or weird-looking look the way they normally do (since they aren't designed to match the OS's theme anyway) and makes the UI elements match the KDE theme.UPDATE: I found a way to fix text boxes more universally, consistently, and less painstakingly: the inherit option!`

/* Written by Jimi Bove. This script modifies websites and UI elements I've run into
that don't match whatever color scheme you're running in KDE. It makes the websites
that somehow become unreadable or weird-looking look the way they normally do (since
they aren't designed to match the OS's theme anyway) and makes the UI elements match
the KDE theme. Right now, I'm using the color scheme called Wonton Soup, so this style
will match it. You can change that by changing the color values in here to whatever
your color scheme is (for the sake of consistency, I recommend getting said color values
from a similar element in the Firefox UI--for example, I took the colors I used for the
Pocket/Read-It-Later list from the Downloads sidebar).

Note that I'm using openSUSE's Firefox KDE integration package, so you may need both
that package and this style to make Firefox fully match your theme. In Ubuntu and Arch,
the package's name is kmozillahelper. You may even also need oxygen-gtk (makes GTK apps
match the KDE theme) in conjunction with these, for all I know. I do not have the Oxygen
Firefox theme/persona/whatever installed, though, because I think it's ugly.

WEBSITES CURRENTLY MODIFIED:
All sites (that have this issue): unreadable textboxes.
myepisodes.com: unreadable button text.

UI ELEMENTS CURRENTLY MODIFIED:
AllInOneSidebar's addons page: unreadable unselected list entries.
Pocket/Read-It-Later list: white & gray colors that don't change to match the theme. */
