@name         Remove Photobucket Anti-Adblock
@namespace    USO Archive

@description  Photobucket employs a anti-adblock tool that displays a popup, blurs photos, and disables scrolling.   This remedies that stupid problem.    If I missed anything, please leave comments. Photobucket is being overzealous about people paying to use their site (not that anyone should really use it these days).
