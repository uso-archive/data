@description    `Photobucket employs a anti-adblock tool that displays a popup, blurs photos, and disables scrolling. This remedies that stupid problem.If I missed anything, please leave comments. Photobucket is being overzealous about people paying to use their site (not that anyone should really use it these days).`
