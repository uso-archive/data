@description    `Images where too big, Heres my own links:Before:http://img216.imageshack.us/my.php?image=qjbeforewl5.pngAfter:http://img216.imageshack.us/my.php?image=qjaftercw2.pngI have the other QJ Cleaner and I didn't like it. So in the end I decided to make one myself. It does many things, some stuff that people may not like, but hopefully someone finds it usefulChanges to the original:-All main text (non headers) are Tahoma @ 9px-Many frames gone, Content is all that remainsThings I plan on fixing/Things I couldn't figure out:-I want to make this a liquid site... but I can't figure out the code to do it, If you look in my CSS you can clearly see where I tried but none of it worked.-I couldn't get that bar at the very top to disappear...Any help with those would be greatly appreciated, pop an email to n00b310@gmail.com*Note that I use adblock, so theres already no ads on mine -- I've also blocked some random images on my after page*`
