@name         Plex Better Poster Titles
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       SpartanG01
@description  Centers Poster Text and Date and allows Poster Text to wrap as needed (Poster Text that results in 4+ lines of wrap will hide the Date and at the 5th line will run into the Poster directly below it. I'm working on increasing the vertical buffer distance dynamically)
