@description    `home.myspace.com is made to look half decent. All the crap that you don't really need or want is removed and the whole thing is given a nice red theme. All the ads don't show up either, but they'll still be loading and slowing the page down. To truly block them download Adblock for fireworks.Edit: MySpace is changing right now, presumably to rectify their shoddy coding. Because of this parts of this code may soon become obsolete. I shall try and keep up with this as best I can. Apparently some guy has ripped off my version and made it blue, but to be honest i don't care and it looks nice enough =P Check it out.I'm also currently experimenting with changing the rest of the Myspace pages too, but theres so many, and therefor so many problems to overcome. Bear with me.`
