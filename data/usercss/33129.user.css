@description  Sick of seeing a header on FA you don't like? Think it's suggestive? Just plain awful? Well here's the problem to solve your bawfests.      Note: You can input your own custom made banners OR you can use one of the previous FA Banners: http://www.furaffinity.net/img/banners/logo/archive/    To change the banner look, put the URL of the picture you'd like here.. "background: url(PLACE YOUR URL HERE)"  and change the height to the image's settings.  Ex: If your image is 100x300px, change the height to 100px and the width to 300px.    NOTE2: To edit a script, go into Manage Styles > FurAffinity Header Blocker > CLICK EDIT > Enter Your Stuffs      ** Before Picture: http://i49.tinypic.com/25ibxpd.png  ** After Picture (Banner Removal): http://i47.tinypic.com/24gt9pi.png  ** Picture examples of your own custom banners: http://i49.tinypic.com/svnecw.jpg    Hope you enjoy :)    [Props to Freehaven to the Script clean up!]  Last updated: 4/25/11
