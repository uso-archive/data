@description  Completely removes the "Highlights" panel in the right sidebar of the new Facebook homepage layout. Ideal for getting your pokes and events back where they should be near the top of the page!      If you want to remove suggestions, pokes, events or anything else please generate your own style at www.customizefacebook.co.uk - just choose what you want to hide on your Facebook homepage and your code will appear immediately! There is also a group for this style and the Customize Facebook website at www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=74162283330.

 * Description:
 *  Removes the highlights panel, sidebar ads/sponsors and
 *  the left filters panel from the new Facebook homepage,
 *  expanding the news stream to fill the space.
 *
 * Last updates:
 *  [22/10/09] Updated highlights code again.
 *  [19/06/09] Another highlights update. More of a permanent fix this time.
 *  [19/06/09] Facebook don't like me. Updated code again after they messed up highlights.
 *  [28/05/09] Updated the code so highlights are still hidden after the FB update
 *  [01/05/09] CustomizeFacebook.co.uk goes live!
 *  [21/04/09] Fixed the bug where the Highlights section would come back
               when there are friend suggestions, at the cost of having the
               Highlights title back.
               Created a Facebook group: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=74162283330 
 *  [03/04/09] Updated code, now removes the Highlights title too!
 *  [02/04/09] Removed redundant code (ignore button no longer exists)
 *             Added code to hide the "Sponsored" section
 *  [25/03/09] Added some code to remove ads - thanks Jonathon
