 * Author: oilyflutesalad
 * Created: 15th March 2009
 *
 * Description:
 *  Removes the highlights panel, sidebar ads/sponsors and
 *  the left filters panel from the new Facebook homepage,
 *  expanding the news stream to fill the space.
 *
 * Last updates:
 *  [22/10/09] Updated highlights code again.
 *  [19/06/09] Another highlights update. More of a permanent fix this time.
 *  [19/06/09] Facebook don't like me. Updated code again after they messed up highlights.
 *  [28/05/09] Updated the code so highlights are still hidden after the FB update
 *  [01/05/09] CustomizeFacebook.co.uk goes live!
 *  [21/04/09] Fixed the bug where the Highlights section would come back
               when there are friend suggestions, at the cost of having the
               Highlights title back.
               Created a Facebook group: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=74162283330 
 *  [03/04/09] Updated code, now removes the Highlights title too!
 *  [02/04/09] Removed redundant code (ignore button no longer exists)
 *             Added code to hide the "Sponsored" section
 *  [25/03/09] Added some code to remove ads - thanks Jonathon
