@description    `Update: This is obsoleted by https://userstyles.org/styles/111851/xenforo-invisitext-handler which was based on this one and is more customizable, I recommend using that one, though this one still works fine. Leaving this up to not break links.Because some people think making text <b>invisible</b> is a great way to hide spoilers, and I don't like reading the <i>page source</i> to see what they're saying.`
