@description    `We all love MyAnimeList, but there's two things it lacks. The first being dark mode, there's a ton of scripts already. But the second is a sticky header. And that's where this script comes in. Nothing fancy, but it does the job. Especially created for people with a small screen who have to take screenshots for Official AWC with both stats far down the page, and their username hidden up top.`
