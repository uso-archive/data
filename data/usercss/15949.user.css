@name         Facebook - Always Show Hidden Filters
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       henasraf
@description  In the newest Facebook layout - this does 3 small simple things I found useful:  1. Makes the hidden filters in the filter list always visible  2. Hides the "More >" link under those which is now obsolete  3. Hides the instructions to drag & drop which are obvious to most of us and if not, they really don't need to be displayed all the time
