@description  Same as Jeuxvideo.TV, Jeuxvideo.com has its own gaminglive webpage.    Here there are the minors modifications :   * Extended playlist to 100% of  its height   * Removing Extra downloads for PSP or Ipod (because It's useless)   * Made the page full sized and centered    Updated : Some tweaks are present in that new version.   * Stylized panel of informations   * Make high screens full centered (you'll see no differences in 1024 * 768 or less)   * Playlists extended at maximum capacity    You can't really see effective modifications when looking at screens, try it in high resolution to see the differences.
