@description  Removes distracting elements from the Reddit website layout, including scoring, so you can focus on socializing instead of votes. Profile information is also hidden, to discourage stalking. Vote buttons remain visible to retain ability to participate. Works best with disabled Subreddit Styles. Should be compatible with other styles/scripts.

 * and value of social scoring systems. Discussion has happened before these
 * systems came about, and it can continue to thrive if we design our
 * systems to protect from "bugs" in our social code, so to speak. Give it
 * a shot and see what it's like to not focus on scores. I find reading
 * Reddit with this style more enjoyable and laidback. It still works well,
 * even without an account, too.
