@name         CPAN - Distinguish visited vs. non-visited links

@description  If you're annoyed that tons of sites choose to render normal links the same as visited links, this user style will fix that.    Visited link SHOULD look differently from non-visited links, to help you tell where you've been already.    Author: Dan Dascalescu  http://dandascalescu.com
