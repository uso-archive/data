@name         Reddit - Remove border around visited items
@namespace    USO Archive

@description  So as reddit is being updated, one of the things they've added is a dotted border around the links you've visited. For now, there isn't an option to remove this, so I wrote this quick little style to remove it, for those who don't know CSS ;)
