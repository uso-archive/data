@description    `Just a quick style I threw together for everyone to set a custom character cutout on HorribleSubs.All images are currently scaled down to a 365 pixel width in order to match the default Asuna image.If you have any suggestions or find anything that seems broken message me on Discord, slendercraft#0913.Make sure to check out my Dark Horrible Subs style as well! :)https://userstyles.org/styles/162062/dark-horriblesubs-2018`
