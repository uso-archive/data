@description  Editorially is shutting down. I hate that fact. And I hate the message on the top of Editorially that reminds me on every screen that it is shutting down.    So I've decided to live in denial. Part of that denial is hiding that message.    WARNING: This will also turn off the alerts that let you know that you are offline. Use with caution.
