@description    `Removes all references to karma from Reddit. This includes comments and submissions. You can still upvote and downvote submissions and comments, because that actually affects Reddit, but you won't see _how_.I thought it was clever, anyway. Means you can post without caring about karma, which is pretty freeing.`
