@name         Reddit minus all the Karma
@namespace    USO Archive

@description  Removes all references to karma from Reddit. This includes comments and submissions. You can still upvote and downvote submissions and comments, because that actually affects Reddit, but you won't see _how_.    I thought it was clever, anyway. Means you can post without caring about karma, which is pretty freeing.
