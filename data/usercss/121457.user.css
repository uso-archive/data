@description  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[My Medium Logo user style - - - - Large Logo user style also available]<br><b>FIXED:</b> Panos' style and other derivatives of it have progressive De-Centering of their Google logo with page-zoom change / a large gray box around the search query box / and a white footer-bar on the Search Results page. <b>ALL 3</b> are fixed in my userstyle. Also, Google logo is larger, more vibrant-colored, with better highlights and 3D effect (Panos' is "washed out"). Detailed "Comments" section at top of CSS demarcates Panos' code from mine, and tutorial shows users how to use their own logo. I also credit Panos for his generally excellent work in my CSS "Comments". I also have a Google favicon mod (a Greasemonkey user script):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Revert to Google's Old 2012-2015 Favicon"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(reverts to the "white lower-case 'g' in a blue square" favicon)...  https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/12271-revert-to-google-s-old-2012-2015-favicon

For the "tl;dr" (Too Long; Didn't Read) crowd, let me apolozize. I call it "The Tyranny of Fine Detail" (my quote.) I am a published scientist and engineer, and approach technical subject matter in meticulous detail. That is my only defense for the accusation of being too wordy. However, some of the details I present will be a good tutorial for some newbies or tinkerers who want to modify CSS code, learn new tricks, etc. I've always evangelized for both a "better" web, and a "better looking" web." So those who haven't yet gotten their feet wet in User Styles or User Scripts (such as Greasemonkey, etc), might be inspired to "jump in with both feet". If so, all the better.

******************************************************************************

FIRST, I give great praise to Panos for his excellent work !!!

I've been using Black Google by Panos for well over a year, and even praise it (and link to it) on the Greasyfork.org page for my "Revert to Google's Old 2012-2015 Favicon" Greasemonkey script* (with screenshot of the center logo detail). If you hate the new Google favicon foisted on the world Sept 1, 2015 as much as I do, check out my Geasemonkey script...

On the UserStyles.org page for this Style*, I include a secondary screenshot mashup comparing the Google homepage logo (center details only) with User Style enabled - showing Panos' style at top, and my larger-logo style at the bottom, making comparison of the 2 styles easy. That screenshot is linked in "More screenshots" below the main displayed screenshot of this style.
 * https://userstyles.org/styles/121457/black-google-by-panos-mod-by-r-schneider-sm

After posting my original Style as "Black Google by Panos - Modified by R. Schneider", with large logo, I then
    also posted a second style, with a smaller logo (still larger than Panos'), and renamed my original style.
     My 2 styles are:
 * "Black Google by Panos - Mod by R. Schneider (Lg)" - logo size = 476x211 pixels
 * "Black Google by Panos - Mod by R. Schneider (Sm)" - logo size = 345x153 pixels
            [My (Sm) version was originally posted with logo size = 281x125 pixels]
                  The Original, "Black Google by Panos" logo size = 281x103 pixels

All code not mentioned or referred to in this COMMENTS section are Panos'.

***********************************************************************************
***********************************************************************************

                    FIX FOR PANOS' CENTERING/DE-CENTERING ISSUE

The original "Black Google by Panos", which I've used for over a year, has always suffered from a Google logo centering issue. The HORIZONTAL CENTERING IS ONLY APPROXIMATE, AND THE LOGO DRAMATICALLY DE-CENTERS WITH PAGE ZOOM MAGNIFICATION. I posted my first derivative, "Black Google by Panos - Mod by R. Schneider (Lg)", having a much larger logo than Panos'. With Panos' code (even after adjusting Values of his various #lga>* code block Properties), I found great difficulty centering the large logo. Then, I found that by REMOVING 3 lines of Panos' code (Declarations), my large logo automatically centered PERFECTLY, and remained centered REGARDLESS of page zoom - WITHOUT adding or adjusting any "position" Properties or Values. Then I posted my second style, "Black Google by Panos - Mod by R. Schneider (Sm)", having a smaller logo (but larger than Panos'). I found that removing those 3 lines from Panos' code alone DID NOT result in perfect centering for a smaller logo. I then found a universal way to perfectly center a logo regardless of size, by putting an ADDED Value ("center") in the "background:url" Declaration, as long as those 3 problematic code lines were removed.
 [NOTE: CSS speak: a Declaration comprises a Property and a Value, separated by a colon, i.e.,  a Declaration = some Property:some Value]

[If you look at other Google homepage styles on UserStyles.org (especially other dark or black styles), you will see other styles that DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE to being centered, let alone during page zoom - I even tried 2 of them - "My Black Google by Panos", and Black Google Derivative") based on Panos' - before settling on Panos' style for more than a year. Those other styles may have inherited Panos' issue from his code - I didn't examine theirs. After publishing my own styles, however, I wasn't satisfied to accept the problem, and worked for hours to find the fix (it probably should have taken me only 30 minutes or less). It was the fact that there were 3 superfluous lines of code - that could either have their Properties OR Values modified, or entire Declarations deleted - individually, or in combination, that threw me into chaos).]

BOTTOM LINE - 3 lines of Panos' code should be REMOVED (for any logo size), and 1 Declaration needs an ADDED Value. Additionally, 1 Property's's Value must be MODIFIED to adjust the logo's vertical position. (Full details are listed in the "TO CHANGE THE VERTICAL POSITION OF THE LOGO" section below, and in the "commented-out" text block in the CSS just above the #lga>* code block (in the mid-800s of code line numbers), and in the in-line "comments" for the 5 code lines in that block that require Value changes or Declaration removals. The 3 lines of Panos' original code that should be removed are left in-place (for historic versioning), BUT ARE "COMMENTED-OUT" (with added text explanation), in my style's code.

[NOTE: Using my code fix as described above DOES result in PERFECT centering of the Google logo (regardless of page zoom magnification) - as measured by a millimeter rule on an actual display monitor. HOWEVER, PANOS' QUERY BOX IS SLIGHTLY OFF CENTER BELOW THE LOGO - it is such a minor distraction that I do not intend to troubleshoot or attempt to fix it at this time. THEREFORE, the horizontal logo position and the query box don't have the same center point, so their relative centering is "off". It is the query box, not the logo, that is "off-center" (shifted right by 3mm on my display - yielding 6mm more distance between left edge of display to query box, than from the right edge of display to query box). There is also a partial black box outline artifact around the top and left side of the query box, shifted up and left. At this time, the minor query box anomalies don't interest me. Be assured though, that the logo centering issue appears to be perfectly resolved.]

***********************************************************************************
***********************************************************************************

                   TO CHANGE THE VERTICAL POSITION OF THE LOGO

ALL USERS NOTE: To suit your personal preference, you can CHANGE THE VERTICAL POSITION OF THE LOGO between the query box and top of the webpage, by changing a number-of-pixels Value in a the CSS. The pixel Value can be changed quickly, and results are seen on the webpage as soon as you click "Save" in the Stylish Code Editor, WITHOUT a webpage refresh. The pixel Value you can experiment with is the "padding:_px!important;" line in the #lga>* code block. (The "_" represents whatever number of pixels is chosen). See the text block in this COMMENTS section labeled...

************  EASY WAY TO FIND the #lga>* code block, and the "CHANGES"" COMMENT TEXT BLOCK ABOVE IT  ************

for details on how to use the Stylish Code Editor to find the #lga>* code block (which has the "padding:_px!important;" line in it).

Increasing the number of pixels pushes the logo further down from the top of the webpage, closer to the query box.
Decreasing the number of pixels does the opposite.

DON'T FORGET TO CLICK "SAVE" IN ORDER TO HAVE YOUR CHANGE IMPLEMENTED, AND TO SEE THE RESULT.

Further info on #lga>* code block modifications are found in a large "commented-out" text block above the "Legal Notice" block.

***********************************************************************************

There are 3 errors in Panos' CSS code (3 different lines of code) - reported when the "Check for Errors" button of the Stylish Editor is clicked. All 3 of those errors are labeled "Error in parsing value for 'background' - Declaration dropped". The 3 code lines with Errors reported all involve "webkit" values, so those 3 lines only affect WebKit-based browsers (Google Chrome/Chromium, Apple Safari, Opera) - I use Firefox, but none of the others, so I've never seen any effect. I ran a Ctrl+F search for webkit, and those 3 error lines are the only webkit code lines in Panos' CSS. Since those errors won't affect Firefox-only users (like me), I made no attempt to troubleshoot or fix those 3 "errors" - they remain...

NOTE: I've seen CSS code in another Stylish user style where the Stylish Code Editor flags ALL WebKit declarations as Errors - - could these be Stylish Code Editor "false positive" error detections?

            ********************************

I wanted to modify Panos' style with a different Google logo, having a darker color hue and higher color saturation, and with nice highlighting and shading for a better 3D effect (I think the logo used by Panos looks "washed out", and is too small for me). [See the screenshots comparison mentioned in the 4th paragraph above, "On the UserStyles.org page...".] I think the logo edits I made (darker hue, more color saturation, etc) create a more vibrant image - with more visual "punch". My original modification of Panos' user style used my new logo resized to the same width as Panos', but it was 22 pixels higher. I adjusted Panos' code to properly position my taller logo, and it worked and looked good - but then decided to use a MUCH LARGER version of my logo instead, similar to the size used by the standard Google logo and some of the Google Doodles. My new logo was significantly larger than both Panos' and my first replacement logo. But my style suffered from the same issue that has always affected Panos' style - his logo is only approximately centered, and it dramatically and progressively de-centers when the page is zoom magnified. I troubleshot and fixed that problem - complete details can be found in the "FIX FOR PANOS' CENTERING/DE-CENTERING ISSUE" between the 2-line asterisks separator lines above, and in the "commented-out" text block in the CSS code [demarked ******  CHANGES FOR NEW LOGO (NOTES by R. SCHNEIDER) ******] - search the code for the string "#lga>*" (without quotes) to find the relevant code block, in the mid-800s of code line numbers (search details below)...

I decided to publish a second style with another logo size choice - a second style instead of using a Style Settings drop-down box (which requires the user to choose one style before installation, or accept the default) - because doing so limits the user to only one installed logo size. Publishing the second style enables users to download both styles, and change which of 2 logos to display with a simple click of the Stylish logo (when on Google's homepage), then clicking to enable or disable each of the 2 installed styles. In a split moment, users can change the Google homepage logo size on a whim, IF 2 separate styles are installed. Other than the logo size, both my "...(Lg)" and "...(Sm)" styles are identical - exactly the same CSS is used, EXCEPT for the "lga>*" code block's image URL and "padding:_px" value.

************  EASY WAY TO FIND the #lga>* code block, and the "CHANGES"" COMMENT TEXT BLOCK ABOVE IT  ************

In Firefox Add-ons Manager -> User Styles -> click "Edit" for this style. Once in Stylish's code editor, click the code area of the window to fix focus, press "Ctrl+F" on your keyboard, type in "#lga>*" (without quotes), press "Enter" on keyboard (all found strings are then highlighted), then scroll down past the highlighted strings displayed in this COMMENTS section to the #lga>* block in the CSS code (below the 17 lines of "#hplogo-n," - code lines numbered in the mid-800s). I've included "commented-out" text above the code block detailing the changes that must be made for different logo sizes.

Details about the origin of the graphics for the logo I used, and how any user can substitute their own logo, appear below.

If users want to see my logo in a different size (or use my original small, same-width-as-Panos') logo, I uploaded 4 to PostImage.org (from which this Style pulls 1 of those 4 - more about PostImage.org below) - URLs and pixel sizes are shown below. NOTE: after using a different size logo (either one of mine, or one of your choosing), changes must be made in the #lga>* code block to accommodate size differences - see my "commented-out" section referred to in the 2nd paragraph above for details.

One thing I like about Stylish User Styles is that as soon as edit changes are made and "Save" is clicked at the top of the Stylish CSS editor, the affected webpage immediately shows the user style changes WITHOUT requiring a page refresh. This makes it quick and easy to see whether you need to tweak your code changes, or if you made an error.

NOTE: If you use your own logo with different dimensions, or simply don't like the vertical positioning of the logo between the query box and top of page, modifying the "paddig:_px!important;" line in the #lga>* code block can be changed to suit your preference. Further hints are included in the "TO CHANGE THE VERTICAL POSITION OF THE LOGO" section above in these COMMENTS, and in the "CHANGES..." text block "commented-out" above the #lga>* code block discussed in the next paragraph.

[By following my example and the instructions below, any user can substitute their own edited logo - and upload their image to a free image hosting site. PostImage.org is good, free, never deletes due to inactivity (Panos' host site, imgur.com, deletes all images not viewed at least once in a 6-month period), and does NOT require Registration. After the image is uploaded to an image hosting site, specify the image's URL in the CSS code (insert into Panos' code at "background:url" in the code block "#lga>*" - Ctrl+F search this style for the "#lga>*" string, without the quotes) - NOTE: Embedding a base64-encoded image as "CSS Background Source Data" in place of the external "Background URL" is NOT recommended - that would likely make the modified style CSS TOO LARGE to be hosted on UserStyles.org. (From https://userstyles.org/help/coding: ("Limits on User Styles" section) "Maximum size is 100,000 bytes. Exemptions are possible by contacting me <link to admin Jason Barnabe's email>, I won't grant exemptions if you're using embedded images"). Jason advises external image hosting with a "background:url" code line pointing to it, as used by Panos and me.]

I started with a 1400 x 1050 wallpaper of Google's logo which didn't have a mirror-reflection. (I couldn't find a good image with the bottom mirror reflection, but ever since seeing Panos' style, I wanted the mirroring. I had no idea there were so few Google logo images with a GOOD mirror reflection). The wallpaper I chose had a logo-only center detail of 1175 x 438 pixels....
  - That logo was cropped out and resized downward;
  - Its gamma & color saturation were increased to change the highlighting appearance;
  - A mirrored bottom was added (like the one I liked so much in Panos' logo. However, I didn't use a mirror
    reflection under the "g" descender. In Panos's logo, there was a descender "shadow", not a true "reflection").

  * Panos' original image:

  * 1400 x 1050 Wallpaper from which the new logo was taken:

  * R. Schneider's final edit, with color corrections, added mirroring, and resizing, for my "(Lg)" Large logo style:
     - http://s13.postimg.org/jji2zt553/gglmrrblk_476x211.png
        (inserted into Panos' code... Ctrl+F search for the string "#lga>*" (without the quotes).

* I also modified some obsolete "@-moz-document" URLs in Panos' code, as follows:
  - Removed no-longer-valid "https://encrypted.google", "http://209.85.165.104" & blogsearch entry (discontinued by
    Google);
  - Added "https://images.google" and "https://www.blogger";
  - Added the "https" protocol to replace "http" in Panos' code where needed (based on current sites' URLs).
  - Further "@-moz-document" modifications may be required in the future, FOR... As we all know:
      "The Only Thing Constant About Google Is Change."

/******  CHANGES FOR NEW LOGO (NOTES by R. SCHNEIDER) ******************************************

* The URL in "background:url" is changed to point to R. Schneider's new logo (see COMMENTS section at top). [Panos' original = http://i.imgur.com/KAfdVfw.png]

* Panos' original #lga>* code block results in ONLY APPROXIMATE CENTERING OF THE GOOGLE LOGO, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, the logo position DRAMATICALLY AND PROGRESSIVELY DE-CENTERS with page zoom magnification. I discovered this issue with my small logo "Black Google by Panos - Mod by R. Schneider (Sm)" style, which uses Panos' code. I noticed the logo de-centering issue is the same with Panos' style and my small logo style, even though my logo size is different. After troubleshooting the Panos de-centering issue, I discovered the fix below:
       
 [NOTE: CSS speak: a Declaration comprises a Property and a Value, separated by a colon, i.e.,  a Declaration = some Property:some Value]

* REMOVING 3 lines of Panos' code (Declarations) - "position: absolute!important;", "top: 195px!important;"," AND "left: 40%!important;" - RESULTS IN PERFECT CENTERING OF A "LARGE" LOGO, WITH "NO" DE-CENTERING WHEN PAGE IS ZOOMED, without any further changes. ["SMALL" logos (like Panos') need an additional fix]...

* ADD the "center" Value to the "background:url" Declaration, as shown in the code below. This results in PERFECT LOGO CENTERING, WITH NO DE-CENTERING WHEN PAGE IS ZOOMED, WITH "SMALL" LOGOS. (NOTE - the "center" Value addition to the "background:url" DECLARATION is "REQUIRED" with "SMALL" logos.

* ADJUST THE VERTICAL POSITIONING OF THE GOOGLE LOGO TO SUIT YOUR PREFERENCE by modifying the "padding:_px!important;" code line. (The higher the pixel Value number, the more the logo gets "pushed down" from the top of the screen). Adjust the "px" Value to either accommodate differing height images, or different vertical positioning user preference. NOTE: ADJUSTMENT IS PROBABLY REQUIRED, EVEN FOR AN UNCHANGED LOGO, "after" first adding the "center" Value to the "background:url" Declaration.

* MAKING ALL THE CHANGES DESCRIBED ABOVE (and shown below) TO PANOS' CODE RESULTS IN PERFECT LOGO CENTERING, REGARDLESS OF PAGE ZOOM MAGNIFICATION, FOR BOTH "SMALL" AND "LARGE" LOGOS. I assume this also applies regardless of display screen pixel resolution, due to the way the "center" Value in the "background:url" Declaration works.
       
* BOTTOM LINE - With either large logos or small logos, Panos' 3 code line Declarations mentioned above (and shown below) should be REMOVED. With smaller logos, adding the "center" Value to the "background:url" Declaration is REQUIRED (see code below) - but with some large logo sizes it's NOT REQUIRED (possibly due to CSS or <div style... elements in Google's HTML). It's probably best to simply USE the "center" Value in ALL "background:url" Declarations, regardless of logo size - then, if the logo is later changed to a different size, no code adjustment would be needed... FINALLY, AFTER "center" is added to "background:url", ADJUST THE LOGO's VERTICAL POSITION by modifying the "padding:_px!important;" pixel Value number.[Adjusting it too small can result in cropping of the logo, EVEN ITS WIDTH - strange, huh?]

(With Panos' original code, the logo was only approximtely centered, and it de-centered dramatically, and progessively more, with page zoom).
