@name         Delphi Forums: unsqueeze forum page on FF 3
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       bitpicker
@description  This script amends an error which causes the general forum and chat page on Delphi to squeeze towards the left instead of using the full width of the browser window.    This seems to apply only to FF 3, installation on older versions is not necessary.
