@name         Show XUL Tree Lines - Firefox 3 - Windows platform
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Roland de Ruiter
@description  The default theme of Firefox 3 on the Windows platform does not show tree lines on the XUL tree widget.     This style corrects that.     XUL Tree Widget: http://developer.mozilla.org/samples/xultu/examples/ex_advtrees_1.xul    A tree is quite a useful widget to show hierarchical data and is used at several places in Firefox:  - Bookmarks sidebar: View > Sidebar > Bookmarks  - History sidebar:         View > Sidebar > History  - Cookie list:                 Tools > Options > Privacy > Show Cookies  - Certificates:               Tools > Options > Advanced > Encryption > View Certificates  - DOM Inspector (now an extension for FF3, https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6622)    I found it quite annoying that the tree lines had disappeared in Firefox 3, especially while inspecting deeply nested structures with the DOM Inspector.
