@description    `The default theme of Firefox 3 on the Windows platform does not show tree lines on the XUL tree widget. This style corrects that. XUL Tree Widget: http://developer.mozilla.org/samples/xultu/examples/ex_advtrees_1.xulA tree is quite a useful widget to show hierarchical data and is used at several places in Firefox:- Bookmarks sidebar: View > Sidebar > Bookmarks- History sidebar:         View > Sidebar > History- Cookie list:                 Tools > Options > Privacy > Show Cookies- Certificates:               Tools > Options > Advanced > Encryption > View Certificates- DOM Inspector (now an extension for FF3, https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6622)I found it quite annoying that the tree lines had disappeared in Firefox 3, especially while inspecting deeply nested structures with the DOM Inspector.`
