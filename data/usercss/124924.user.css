/*
	Small Improvements for the Paizo Forums

	created by Michael Miller
	(parody@esglabs.com)

    Version: 1.3.0

    Version History:
    1.3.0: Added !important to link decorations (underlines).
    1.2.0: Changed thread link colors and added spacing after each thread entry.
           Because the site is so volatile at present, updates may be frequent.
           Make sure you disable your styles on occasion to see the actual
           appearance of the site; you might like it better.
    1.1.0: Adjustments for Paizo's major website redesign on 2018-02-27.
    1.0.0: First release.
