@description  Reverts the YouTube search results back to their original size.    As of yesterday YouTube has changed the look of the search results on one of my accounts to extremely giant tiles that made me feel like I was browsing the mobile version of the site. The big search results were gone when I logged out or used another account though, which means YouTube is now forcing certain accounts over to this horrible new style. I expect this change will be applied globally soon.    Their motto: "NO QUESTIONS! CONSUME PRODUCT! HERE IS PRODUCT IN YOUR FACE!"    So I made this little script that reverts the search results back to their original size for everyone who is currently affected by this change.    Please note that I'm not an experienced scripter as I stitched this together in an hour by using code from the original, unaffected search results and a bit of my own code. Feel free to edit this as you please.
