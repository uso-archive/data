@description  Makes Youtube Cinema Mode do what it should actually do and fill the browser window.    DON'T PANIC! The search bar isn't gone on video pages, it's just hidden by default now. All you have to do is hover over the top of the screen where the search bar should be and it will appear! :)    Completely disablable just by turning cinema mode off with the button next to fullscreen on the player.    Should play nice with other themes unless they've mucked around with the positioning themselves in which case YMMV.
