@description  For users who think the coloring on the location bar for security is beyond excessive. You will still retain the added coloring around the location bar favicon, and you should still click on the favicon to read the "More Information"  which is the same as was and is available using Tools (menu) -> Page Info    If you are concerned about the loss of information within a properties context menus for links, images, providing File Size, Last Modified Date, Content Type and HTTP Header of a link target or of an image,   you should install the "Extended Link Properties" extension   https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/798/     To read what the coloring is supposed to tell you, see these articles:  --   Mike Beltzner, A quick (3min:50sec) prerelease overview of some of the new features in Firefox 3.  --   http://digg.com/software/What_s_new_in_Firefox_3_Check_out_this_demo    -- Wikipedia article:  Address bar    -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_bar     -- Firefox Support articles:  Site Identity Button  (nicknamed "Larry" the passport officer)  -- http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Site+Identity+Button    Firefox 3.7 again respects browser.identity.ssl_domain_display set to 0  http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser.identity.ssl_domain_display    This is one of several styles to minimize wasted space on toolbars, look for other styles under my name, user 12592.    2010-05-19 Posted
