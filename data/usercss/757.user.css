@description  This style sets the results of the Safari print link to the font in your Firefox user settings. It also sets the size of the pre tags to about 2/3 of that setting. This is because their pre tags do not break and thus run off the page when you print. (PRE tags are used for their code samples.) So reducing the font helps a bit. I print in landscape mode. If you are using portrait mode, you may have to reduce the pre font-size of pre even more. Also you can change the size, using percentages, ems, or simply px as you wish. Finally, I access safari from safari.oreilly.com. If you signed up with another publisher you will probably have to change the url-prefix to the one you use.     If you want a title to appear on the page see my greasemonkey script at http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/5108    I used the style 526 by user 409 as the base for this, stripping out most everything since font sizes and layout are really all that I was interested in.     Tuesday August 8, 2006, added code to remove the repeating headings printed at the top of EVERY page...
