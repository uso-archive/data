@name         Darker Font - Jim Can Read It!
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Jim Dodd
@description  A simple darkening fonts on a page when needed. Downside is that it may hide light colored lettering on a dark background.    I only use this if I really just can't read a real light font and zooming in doesn't help.    Works on all URLs
