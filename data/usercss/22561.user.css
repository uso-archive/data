@description    `This will change your default logo of WBB. It will replace it with a logo of your choice! You can create your own logos with the default sizes of the original one made by 'dexteer'. To replace it you have just to upload your logo to an image host and replace the the default link in the style with your own link. I used the 'World Teachers Day' Logo as default logo, I like it very much :DShort tutorial to add your own logo:1. Let's imagine you already uploaded your own logo to any image host2. Install the style3. Open Stylish => Manage Styles4. Choose WBB Custom Logo, then hit 'EDIT'5. Find the tinypic link and replace it with your own logo link6. Click 'Save'7.
