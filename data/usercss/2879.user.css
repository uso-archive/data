@name         Fastladder - More feeds in Flat view
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       shigefumi
@description  This style shows more feeds in Flat view without scrolling on Fastladder.    Note:  If feeds have long title, you cannot see unread count.    This style based on http://blog.livedoor.jp/hakin/archives/50833924.html for livedoor Reader.      /*  I think Fastladder is the fastest web-based RSS reader.  And some tips make it faster for people reading hundreds of feeds.  - Use keyboard shortcuts.  -- For example, S key shows next feed and prefetches next 2 feeds in the background.  - Change some settings.  -- Show only updated feeds: enabled.  -- Number of 'My Feeds' to show: Set limit to 10-20 feeds. (based on your window size)  -- My Feeds view: Flat and Rating.  *\/
