@name           Plurk - Hide "Promote" and "Front" links
@namespace      USO Archive
@author         haecvir
@description    `This hides the "promote" link on every plurk, as well as hiding the "Front" link at the top of the plurk window. Note that this will change it on EVERY plurk timeline, not just your own. People will still be able to promote your plurks, and you can promote other people's plurks by temporarily turning off this style in Stylish.Last updated: 4/26/11`
