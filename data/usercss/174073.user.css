@description  This theme removes the subscription overlay and shows every full NKNews Article.    USE STYLUS, NOT THE STYLISH EXTENSION. Stylus is open source and in every browser extension store, but the Stylish extension/app got bought out and started recording and selling browser history; all browsers removed it from their web stores. Stylus still allows you to install themes from this Stylish site, without the spying. Google it if you want more info.
