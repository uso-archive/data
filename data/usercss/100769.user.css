@description    `This is a "rebuild" from memory of the original "The Secret World" official forums background .This little style mod (actually really nothing more than a single line of CSS) is intended for any player who liked 'em better, or disagreeing with Funcom enforcing new partnair project advertising.(as a matter of fact, advertising this project was perfectly fine but no option is left to change background, which is wrong as far as paying customers are concerned)Original artwork copyrights owned and made by some anonymous but great Funcom's artist.I do not own the original artwork in any way.`
