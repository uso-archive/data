@name         Dota 2 Wiki (dota2wiki.com) - Remove Curse sidebar
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Zik
@description  This style will remove the sidebar on Curse's Dota 2 Wiki which was added on September 27th, 2012 and many other annoying features.  The goal of this is to accomplish a style for the wiki that is not influenced by Curse's profit decisions, it will turn the Dota 2 Wiki into a beautiful page which is clear and simple for browsing.    These are the full list of features that are removed upon installing this style:  - Top advertisement  - contentSub on the main page (it causes a small gap that makes the language box look odd, this is something the wiki admins should have fixed themselves to begin with)  - Bottom advertisement  - Curse sidebar on any page except main page (as there is none on it)  - Curse's self-advertisement of their other sites.
