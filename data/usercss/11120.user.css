@description  Well!  Fixing the line-spacing wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it would be.  Use this code to fix the forum text color and gigantic line spacing at the Rock Band Forums.  I don't think I'll update it any further as I don't really want to intrude on their format and branding scheme, but these simple changes make it VASTLY better IMO.
