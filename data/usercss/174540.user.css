 ***** DuelingNexus Game End Window Fix (Browswer)
 * ignore the warning; we need to target a specific element for this to work
 * as for the visuals of the fix, this script targets horizontal displays
 * YMMV with the benefits, but this script is guarenteed to provide clearer
 * fields on displays of a similar proprtion to 1920x1080 or wider.
