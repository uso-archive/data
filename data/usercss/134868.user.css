@name         Gmail Simple Default Rebirth Theme

@description  Description:    It's been a couple of years since my first stylish theme with almost 2000 installs. These days I've toned back to using bare minimal design and not trying to tweak the hell out of stylish as thing eventually break the more you use different plugins. So you have a very simple compatible theme that will work with everything. The aim of this theme was compatibility but still clean up the user interface of those working in the Gmail interface.
