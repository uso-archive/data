@name         Animated Loading Spinner for Firefox 3 - Loading
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       dotter
@description  Displays a Spinning Animated Firefox Logo (Spinfox) when loading a page in Firefox 3 (About:Blank)    Both the Loading New Tab AND the About:blank's background image will be animated.  When you open a new tab, it will display this animated image until something from that site is able to be displayed.      * Loosely based on user 1744's style 1761 , and My style 6488 code... Thanks!    Features:  + Appears when opening new tabs  + Appears when loading new tabs content  + Appears within loading page contents (a loading div control containing a frame of another site)  + Appears when a page transitions to external or new domain  + Works in Firefox 3!  + Clean and very appropriate animated default image, included with style (Firefox logo Spinning)  + Makes your browser look great, and adds that "wow" factor.    Additional Information:  *NOTE: Please Clear your Cache and Restart your browser after installing or changing this style, your custom image will need to be cached in order for it to be displayed.    * You may have to disable the following two styles for this to work:  - Custom About:Blank logo  - Custom New Tab Loading Image    Similar Styles:  For a similar userstyle, check out Style 8874    About:Spinner:  - The reason I do not use an Encoder is because I already tried to use an encoder, and it MAXES out the Max-Character size for Userstyles.org.  - The only solution would be to locally link it to your own hard drive....  - I can encode it properly locally, but cannot share the encoded style on userstyles without it kicking me out!  - Any further suggestions are appreciated  + This style does still work great    Changelog:  - Initial Release
