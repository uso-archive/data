@description    `Displays a Spinning Animated Firefox Logo (Spinfox) when loading a page in Firefox 3 (About:Blank)Both the Loading New Tab AND the About:blank's background image will be animated.  When you open a new tab, it will display this animated image until something from that site is able to be displayed.  * Loosely based on user 1744's style 1761 , and My style 6488 code... Thanks!Features:+ Appears when opening new tabs+ Appears when loading new tabs content+ Appears within loading page contents (a loading div control containing a frame of another site)+ Appears when a page transitions to external or new domain+ Works in Firefox 3!+ Clean and very appropriate animated default image, included with style (Firefox logo Spinning)+ Makes your browser look great, and adds that "wow" factor.Additional Information:*NOTE: Please Clear your Cache and Restart your browser after installing or changing this style, your custom image will need to be cached in order for it to be displayed.* You may have to disable the following two styles for this to work:- Custom About:Blank logo- Custom New Tab Loading ImageSimilar Styles:For a similar userstyle, check out Style 8874About:Spinner:- The reason I do not use an Encoder is because I already tried to use an encoder, and it MAXES out the Max-Character size for Userstyles.org.- The only solution would be to locally link it to your own hard drive....- I can encode it properly locally, but cannot share the encoded style on userstyles without it kicking me out!- Any further suggestions are appreciated+ This style does still work greatChangelog:- Initial Release`
