@description    `Because wider isn't always better.Have you ever tried reading text across 1300 or 1700 pixels?  How about those sites that cram everything into the left 800 pixels?This style creates a maximum 1011 pixel space in the middle of the screen and places the current content inside of it.Why 1011 pixels?  Because that's the usable space on a 1024x768 monitor with a scrollbar.  If you use the same stylish.sqlite across multiple computers you won't even notice it on a 1024 monitor.  You can adjust this number a couple of pixels either way depending on the width of your scrollbar.  Adjust it so that you don't see the borders on a 1024 monitor.This style is not intended to be used globally, just where a wide screen looks awkward.  I've included plenty of examples but you will have to add your own domains and url-prefixes.You may occasionally see something outside of the box.  This usually means that the page you are viewing has styled an element as "position:absolute" and you will have to live with it or edit the page's css.`
