@description  Whats it do?  Gets rid of the embedded stream viewer to better fit a narrow display.  You'll need a secondary window like the popout player. (Which also prevents purple screens during ad timer.)    Essentially you'll end up with a Bet+Chat Window and a Stream Window. I fill a monitor with these two windows.    This is a really dumb and simple style intended for just me but given the nature of the site I figured I'd at least add these notes.
