@name         Facebook - Hide "People you may know" in News Feed

@description  This style hides the "People you may know" section which appears in the News Feed of Facebook.    UPDATE, January 2017 - Facebook has made a change to their coding which causes the first entry of every post to be hidden (this is occurring now for me, at least) if this Style is utilized, thus this Style should be disabled for now.  If I'm able to find a way to hide the "People you may know" element without causing those other entries to be affected, I'll update this Style accordingly and update this announcement indicating that I've done so.
