@description  ⧸ Style for <a href="http://www.mycandylove.com/">www.mycandylove.com</a> ⧸  <br><small>It's not an exact replica, but the differences should get smaller the longer I work on it. <br><br>  <sup>* Case-sensitive.<br>** [In beta stage, not sure how well it will work in the long-run.] For browsers that support Linear-Gradients. If not, the solid card color will act as a fallback. (also, here's a good <a href="http://www.cssmatic.com/gradient-generator">Gradient Generator</a> to make things easier.)<br>*** Unfortunately, there's a character limit on the "free-form" text option. There's a way to get around this, but I don't know how well it works for different browsers. If you inspect the text box and change the "maxlength" number to a larger one (90 should be plenty), then you can bypass the max character limit for that single install/update (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/yaR4LM9.gif">gif example</a>).
