/* Style information:
   ==================
   I. INTENT
   The intention of this style is to resolve issues with the input box. It's a
   poorly-optimized waste of space which could do with some touching up, though this
   first version of input box fixes is also intended to be the most universal,
   taking a lazy and ugly approach to resolving it.

   II. ISSUES
   The problem with this approach is, the buttons at the right side stretch to fit
   the height of the text box. The only reason this is a problem is because the
   default theme, Dawn uses box shadows, and due to how the interface is designed
   changing the height of the buttons causes the appearance of the input box to
   not look correct, which doesn't affect other themes. See next paragraph.

   III. USE OF OTHER THEMES
   If using another theme via IRCCloud's account settings, the code provided in
   the next section will adjust the buttons to the right to be 30px wide and tall.
   When reverting to Dawn theme, the undesired behaviour of having the buttons
   active anywhere along the length of the text box is restored.
