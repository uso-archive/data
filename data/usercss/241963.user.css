@description  This <i>should</i> force all links to become blue #0000EE and underscored, regardless of having visited or not (or hovering, or while clicking).&nbsp; If the pic on this page is covered by ads so that you can't see the sample screenshot, here's a blurry copy (hosted on Pinterest, so it's lost some of the finer detail) — sorry for the link, but it seems that the image itself won't show up here: <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/41/d5/b4/41d5b408b4b3de10bc0e9ae43b9a61d4.jpg">screenshot of Wikipedia with style installed</a>.    Sometimes there's no underscore (as with Google results' links, unless hovered over [DuckDuckGo is OK, oddly]) — hence my release note section below.    For a tutorial on writing CSS work skin rules (with a focus on fonts, colors, highlighting, circling, etc. on AO3, and can be used for general CSS purposes), please see <b><i><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/28934610">Fonts, and colors, and work skins, oh my!</a></i></b>.
