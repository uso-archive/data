@name         facebook news feed remover II
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       waffle
@description  Since I lost my login for my other account, I'll be posting under here.     Anyways, this is a hardcore update to the previous news feed remover. Some of you may not like it, may think it's too damn much, but hey, I like my facebook virginized. :P    Everything is laid out pretty nicely, so feel free to modify, change, etc whatever you want. If you have suggestions for new stuff let me know. I'll update the style again once facebook is finished with their new roll-out.      oh, must note, this gets rid of that 'facebook chat' program.
