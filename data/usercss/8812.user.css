@description  This Style allows you, should you so wish it, to alter the transparency/opacity of all the cells you have in Fast Dial.    I have put together a similar theme which also has the option of varying Opacity on Hover  See:  http://userstyles.org/styles/9309    If you look at the code, you will see that it allows you to change the transparency of the Dialing Cells (created by "Add to Fast Dial"),  separately from  the non-dialing cells, which are usually attached to a Group.   This means  you for example that you could have all dialing cells with a transparency of 0.9 and all non-dialing cells completely transparent. The choice is of course entirely yours.    f you set the Opacity value to 0.0 (zero) then the cell will become  completely Transparent.  If you set the Opacity to 1.0 (One) it will have no Transparency at all.  (The values in between are  0.1 to 0.9 )     Not to be confused with Transparent Logos which are explained here:  http://userlogos.org/node/461    This opacity fix will unfortunately not resolve Transparency difficulties with Transparent Logos encountered in FD 1.x  when using FF2.    If you are successfully using Transparent  Logos in FD 1.x  in FF3 it is possible  that your interest in opacity may be limited to dialing cells.                     (Before picture no opacity)                        (After picture opacity set to  0.3)
