@description  Remember the way Something Awful used to look? I'm not talking about the forums; there are lots of Greasemonkey scripts (and at least one style, style 2564) out there which make them more pleasant. I'm just talking about the website, and the horrible redesign that happened sometime last year.    Well, this style will eliminate (from the article pages only, so the main navigation of the site isn't affected) all the crowding, allowing you to read the articles at full-width.  It also kills the navigation at the bottom of the page that I find tedious, but if you like it feel free to remove that section of the code.  For that matter, modify any section; I'm not proud.    This is a port of my Greasemonkey script which does essentially the same thing.  Stylish does it better though.
