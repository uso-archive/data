@name         Neopets - Petpage Editor Textarea Fix
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Tiramisu
@description  Am I the only one annoyed by the fact that, you go to edit your pets' petpages, you're confronted with this narrow little text area that just seems to complicate things?    Well, be annoyed no more! This fix will widen the text area and give you more room with which to work!
