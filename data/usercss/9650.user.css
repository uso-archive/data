@name         Link Alert Extension - Transparent Mouse Icons
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       dotter
@description  When hovering over a "special link" (ie. a .EXE file), the Link Alert icon will be transparent, allowing you to see web content behind it.    Obviously, you must have the Firefox Add-on "Link Alert" installed (installer link below)    * Thanks to user 6431 for introducing me into the realm of Transparency with style 6771    You can Customize the amount of transparency by editing the Opacity in the code (Closer to 0 is closer to invisible, whereas closer to 1 is closer to fully-visible - EXAMPLE: 0.5 is in the middle of opacity)  Currently, the code has it at .8 see-thru (which means it is 20% transparent and 80% opaque)    This makes your Link Alerts easier to see behind, allowing you to view all the web page content without moving your mouse, blocking the text or images!    Applies to:  + Hovering over any content type of link (https brings up a lock, .js extension shows a javascript icon, new window shows a window...)  + Transparency on your mouse notification area for each link's file extension or certain Protocols    Additional Information:  * You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.  + This style is FULLY customizable, and you can set the transparency to be almost invisible, almost opaque or anything in between!    Browser Versions:  + Works on Firefox3  + Works on Firefox 2    Integrates with the following Styles:  + Style 8818    ** Must have the Link Alert Extension installed on Firefox ( http://linkalert.googlepages.com/ )    Changelog:  1.0.0.1  + Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.
