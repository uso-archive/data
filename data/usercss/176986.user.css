@name         Hydro-Quebec - Larger Outage Map
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       bedjer
@description  Hydro-Quebec Outage map only allows to see a small portion of the screen.  And the orange triangles showing the area of the outage only appears once we zoom in a lot.  I created a fix for this.  Now we can expand the map to fit the entire monitor - and even into multiple monitors if available.  Now we can zoom in to see all the details and see large portion of the map.    You can also play with the ZOOM factor in the browser to see even more data.  CPU becomes the bottleneck.
