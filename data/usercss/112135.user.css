@description  This CSS hides the "Invite" and "Connect" links that appears on the "People You May Know" section of LinkedIn pages.    I am annoyed that LinkedIn tries to get me to add people in my address book to LinkedIn.  I am happy to let them search my address book to find people *already in LinkedIn* who I could connect to, but I don't want to accidentally spam others in my address book.
