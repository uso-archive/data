@description  Gas prices are truncated rather than rounded. Prices are always rounded down from point 9 which is mathematically incorrect.    I realize it doesn't bother most folks but it bothers me.    I'm putting this up mostly for my own convenience. It may not work for you. It may not suit you.    Make use of it if you want. Feel free to improve or fix it and share your revisions.
