@description    `<b>LATEST VERSION: style 82074 </b>In June 2010, Flickr made some radical design changes to the photo page that were, on the whole, excellent. There were just a few things that bothered me, which I described here:http://www.flickr.com/photos/fjordaan/4731650184/in/set-465611/ This stylesheet items 2 and 4 on my list:(1) Reinstate title above photo(2) Keep the 'photostream' film strip permanently open. (It's currently hidden when you come from a different context, such as Contacts or Favorites.)See also my stylesheet for reinstating the button bar: style 37282Report any issues on the Flickr photo page or Flickr Hacks thread:http://www.flickr.com/photos/fjordaan/5024220354/http://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrhacks/discuss/72157625032814264/`
