@description  Tweaks to the RCGP trainee ePortfolio.    All I wanted to do was demonstrate how easy it would be for the RCGP to widen some of their pages, but I got completely carried away...

/*
 * The following code changes pages from a fixed width of 1050px to a minimum width of 1050px - increasing
 * the useful area on wider monitors.  This makes cells in tables (such as the list of learning logs) take
 * up fewer lines.  It also allows the browser to decide how wide to make the columns, so the edit and delete
 * columns become much narrower, and the longer text cells have fewer line breaks in them.

/*
 * The following code changes the list of learning logs to show more of the beginning of each event
 * It's a complete hack - it hides the contents of the cell and turns the roll-over text into cell contents, 
 * so the roll-over text has gone.
 * 
 * The RCGP would implement this by changing the ASP code so that more of the beginning words are displayed.
 * Presumably they could also increase the amount of text in the roll-over box.
 * 
 * Thank you, Dr Vicky Leyland, for this suggestion
