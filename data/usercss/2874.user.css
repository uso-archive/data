@description    `This style is a combination of four styles: style 178 & style 728 & style 1693 & style 844I've edited them a bit so that they fit together as one style. One problem is that site userstyles.org supports just styles that have no more than 65536 characters. Naturally, combination of four long styles exceeds this limit so it couldn't be uploaded here. If you want to use this style, you can copy&paste it from my site http://peepay.googlepages.com/complete_new_google_look.txtDon't click the "Load into Stylish" button!!! I couldn't leave the "code" field empty and had to write something there but it is NOT the "Complete new Google look" style!`
