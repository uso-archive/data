@name         FF reader mode: real black background

@description  Firefox has the new reader mode (about:reader) to facilitate reading of (almost) any article in a simple, pleasant, constant style. However, the width of the article view is remarkably thin for a single column. Meh... change. This styles allows to customize the width of the view but also to use a layout with more than a single column, making it more akin to a newspaper.    This style based on style 114669 by user 13655. It adds the feature to choose other colors for the dark background mode - where I prefer #000000 as a real dark black. This also works on Firefox for Android and is usable for AMOLED devices, where the #000000 black looks really nice and saves energy.    Note that since September 2016 the width & column setting has been removed as Firefox 49 now has an integrated mechanism to change the width of the reader mode.
