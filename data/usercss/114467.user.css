@name         Fix ANN's broken layout caused by hiding ads
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Shabadadu
@description  This style is meant to be used alongside an ad blocker addon such as ABP, or uBlock.    Anime News Network pages use annoyingly huge ads, larger than the actual content. However hiding them with an ad blocker or other method (in specific, hiding `.left.gutter` and `.right.gutter`) presents a different layout problem:  The article content is displayed in a narrow space on the left side of the page and there is a huge amount of empty space to the right of it. This script narrows the page content (to 1280px), centers them, and removes the empty space.

  /* Short description of ANN DOM structure we care about:
   * body - The background image is attached to it.
   *  div.left.gutter - A container for the ad on the left; should be hidden by the ad blocker
   *  div#canvas - All the actual content, and some ads that don't seem to cause any problems when hidden
   *  div.right.gutter - a container for the ad on the right; should be hidden by the ad blocker
   * 
   * The layout problem that arises by hiding the ads .left.gutter and .right.gutter is that
   * the article content is displayed in a narrow space on the left side of the page and there
   * is a huge amount of empty space to the right of it.
   * This script narrows the page content (to 1280px), centers them, and removes the empty space.
