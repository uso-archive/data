@name         Boing Boing - Fluid width
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       Matt Nordhoff
@description  Forces Boing Boing (http://www.boingboing.net/) to be as wide as the browser window instead of ~800px.    Note: Doesn't seem to work with style 246, though I'm not really sure why. It works fine with style 131, except that the grey background from that style will sometimes be shown around the edges.    (np: I'm going to look at that link. Eventually. Seriously! I will!)
