@description  code by shiibeh\polar\mellø*  the image is a bit glitchy on the far right of the page, but if you zoom it into 125% it should be fine  and also the screenshot is pretty blurry but the actual thing is much higher quality  FULL CREDIT to the one who originally made the code  unfortunately, i do not remember the original artist for the background image.  Isabelle & Animal Crossing both belong to Nintendo so please don't sue me
