@description  This is a revive of an older style as discussed here. http://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/32493/compatible-with-any-ff-after-3    Installation of the addon(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/visited-link-supporter/) is required because mozilla limit the usage of css on visited link for privacy purpose.    Take note that this is a global style, but will only work after you install the addon and include the domain you wish for the style to work into the addon whitelist.    In short, this style will only work for domain in the whitelist of the addon.    I take no credit except for posting it here so others who are searching for a solution may benefit from it.    Important: I use before for bookmark and after for visited to avoid conflict.
