@description  ⧸ Style for <a href="https://vrv.co/">vrv.co</a> ⧸<br>  <br><small>When watching any video it's always so unbearably small, this style fixes that!  Also hides the header/menu bar.<br><br>* If the size is off, you can mess with the height in the advance style settings below.<br>The default is what fits my screen.</small>

@-moz-document domain("vrv.co") { I kinda hate this site sometimes, like it /says/ the "example url" is optional, but that's just a blatant fucking lie. I've spent the last two hours trying to work with using this goddamn sites bullshit "Example url does not match the sites specified in the code." because I was using a regexp. AND DESPITE. ALL. THAT. this was the only way i could make do. Am I stupid? is there a better way? I don't know it if there really is.}*/
