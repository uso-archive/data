@name         Workflowy Fade Out Part Deux
@namespace    USO Archive
@author       kevinrbranson
@description  Fade out your Workflowy notes a little or a lot. Upon rollover or click the notes come to full opacity level. I did not create this style, but I edited it. The original Stylish CSS that I downloaded is nowhere to be found on Stylish anymore, so I recreated it.
