@description    `The profile theme box on gaia is really small, and when you are working with 200+ line CSS files in there, it is really kind of painful.So I made this, which makes it bigger, and wider, hiding the ad that appears next to it, and the info text at the top.takes the 150px tall by 455px wide box, and makes it 800px tall by 900px wide. so much better :D`
