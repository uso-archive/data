@name         Myspace - Simplified home.myspace.com (minus ads)

@description  I used (and liked) style 707 but i wanted a couple things different, so i changed them. Every change is documented in the code, you can change them back pretty easily.    List of changes:    removed "cool new videos" from the home page, because face it, they're not. (5/23/07)    Re-integrate "Hello Yourname!" and made header backgrounds light gray so they stick out a little. Improved compatibility with a couple greasemonkey scripts (most notably add image links 2 -- which is highly recommended) (3/19/07)  I re-integrated the nav bar but added the ability to select which links appear in it (2/17/07)  Signout button exists (on top right)  Search bar exists (with no links)  All(?) homepage ads are now blocked without the need for another extension.  The generic topnav bar DOESN'T exist, because i never use it when i'm on my homepage except to click the search button (but it is very easy to add back in if you want, even if you have never touched css before i'm pretty sure you could figure it out in less than 30 seconds. Just follow my instructions)  Page stats box (profile views etc.) DOESN'T exist because i don't care.  Greybox DOESN'T exist because who has ever clicked on books or comedy?  The square ad next to what used to be a stat box no longer exists.    If you don't like any of these settings, well, i explain (within the stylesheet) what each selector does, so you should be able to pretty easily go in and just reverse whatever you don't like. Basically that means just delete whatever rule is offending you.    I figure the stat box removal might peeve people, so that's right there at the top for easy removal. Just like everything else that i removed, there is a comment describing what it does.    "Bug" fixes:  When you hover over a link, it is now white text on a black background (instead of black on black)  The bulletin headings are now black instead of blue.    I got the ads to disappear! Now, even if you don't have any ad-removing jazz installed you won't be horribly offended. Even the whitespace above the searchbar doesn't exist anymore! I'm excited.(1/25/07)    Apparently "view all friends" is part of the domain "home.myspace.com," which meant that the topnav bar was disappeared from that page too, something i found irritating. So now the topnav DOES appear when you are on the view all friends page. Since i went and learned how to edit a folder inside a domain anyway -- and since the page was a horrible mishmash of black and blue -- i re-styled the whole page to fit in with the theme. (1/26/07)    Known issues:  None! Until you think of something and ask me to change it :)    If you have any requests or recommendations just let me know -- quodlibetor at yahoo dot com or via comments -- and i will try to oblige/fix.
