@description  I've a not-so-large screen, I've bad eye and I've an easy-to-trigger-headache.  While I love wordpress, most traslators amuse (ie need to have just to keep in order what was updated) themself with huge-and-full sidebar that eat a lot of space leaving a lot less space for writing.  This mean that some use small font. Like a 12px or a 14px.  So I worked it out.
