@description    `By replacing default font-family's on Douban (豆瓣: www.douban.com and www.douban.net) with a Chinese Fixed-width Font (by default, SimSun, `宋体'), you can read in a proper manner all articles including programming source code or Vertical written postings generated by GuTiShuWen Transverter (http://www.cshbl.com/shuwen/shuwen.html) or its like.This CSS is so simple that you can hack it by yourself into whatever you like with your favorite Fixed-width font on your Mac or Linux computer.In the future I'm *NOT* making it work over the very areas that showing multi-lined text but the whole Douban site.  Whenever you hate it, just turn OFF this style with your Stylish/GreaseMonkey button on the status-bar (if you leave the button there).`
