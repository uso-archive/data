/*purpose is to move the top bar with the next page links to the top so you don't have to scroll for it
as you don't want to go through the same movie pages each time. Amazon won't let you change display to random so 
search returns are always in the same order.
This css was made for a 15.5 inch laptop and will need adjustment for your display */
