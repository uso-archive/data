  "description": "Applies to:\r\ntuinadvies.be , tuinadvies.nl , matelma.com (be/fr/de)\r\n\r\nWhen viewing a page with many items, the processor (CPU) consumption of the tab can increase a lot. The more you scroll down the page, the more it will use.\r\nSee screenshot (chrome): the \"CPU\" column shows 49.9% used by the tab.\r\nIt is due to the way the page is designed. A picture placeholder (spinning dots) is used for each item while its picture loads. The problem is that this spinning image, while being hidden from your view when the real image is displayed, is still spinning in the background. And there is one for each item. The consequence is that the page can gradually become sluggish, especially when scrolling.\r\n\r\nThis very simple userstyle fixes the issue by completely hiding the spinning images. The tab consumption goes down to 0% when it is applied.\r\n\r\nFor more styles, userscripts, extensions, tips, ..., go to my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://users.skynet.be/alternity/programming/\">programming page</a>",
