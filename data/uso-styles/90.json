{"id":90,"name":"Override tab mix progress bar appearance on tabs","description":"Tab Mix Plus puts the progress bar on tabs, but it can be quite ugly looking.\r\nThis little tweak's transparency lets the tab title show through the progresss bar while it is loading.\r\nThe background-color is the color of the progress bar. Adjust to suit yourself.\r\nAdjust margin-top and margin-bottom to center it on the tab.\r\nYou can also increase margin-top and margin-bottom (along with using max-height) to create a strike-through effect. The color defined in this style goes very nicely with \"Change colors of selected tab\" and \"Change colors of tabs not selected\" which are also posted in my styles section. (I use all these myself)","user":{"id":2,"name":"dougeeebear","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2006-02-16T04:36:14.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1311,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/90_after.png?r=1677312015","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-02-16T04:36:14.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\ntab .tab-progress{\r\n   -moz-appearance: none !important;\r\n   background-color: transparent !important; }\r\ntab .progress-bar{\r\n   background-color: rgb(170,170,255) !important;\r\n   margin-top: 1px !important; \r\n   margin-bottom: -1px !important;  \r\n  -moz-appearance: none  !important; }","discussions":[{"id":3733,"name":"This style makes this extension look so much bette","rating":3,"created":"2006-04-03T16:03:02.000Z","author_name":"reddeye","author_id":75},{"id":3784,"name":"Wow you won't believe it: I installed Stylish afte","rating":3,"created":"2006-04-27T08:07:33.000Z","author_name":"buergi","author_id":147}],"discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
