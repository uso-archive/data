{"id":7967,"name":"Schlock Mercenary - Simplify","description":"This is a very simple script - It takes the Schlock Mercenary site and removes everything that isn't the comic and the nav bar. It pins the nav bar in the upper-left corner of the page for easy access.\r\n\r\nIt does not work correctly without Adblock enabled and blocking the Blank Label Comics SWF floater in the upper-right and the Project Wonderful banner. I can't see how to remove those with my stylesheet.","user":{"id":11210,"name":"caphector","email":"me@caphector.com","paypal_email":"me@caphector.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-06-13T18:53:50.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":94,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/7967_after.png?r=1685606419","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-06-13T18:53:50.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"schlockmercenary","subcategory":"schlockmercenary","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"schlockmercenary.com\") {\r\n\r\ntd.Navigation { position: fixed; right: 10px; top: 10px; }\r\n\r\ntable.SiteBrandingTable, table.calendar, iframe, td.randomblurb, div.transcripttitle, div.transcript, td.Nav, hr, font, form, center\u003ea { display: none; }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/7967/schlock-mercenary-simplify.user.js","style_settings":[]}
