{"id":2595,"name":"MySpace Simple Login Screen","description":"This is my version of MySpace.com... I was not satisfied with the crappy styles on this site, and MySpace has always been full of ads... All I do on the main page is log in, and sometimes I look at the music page... So I removed everything except the login box and changed the background to white... I don't think I can add links to the Music Page through CSS, so I will figure that out later... Comments welcome!!!\r\nP.S. If you want it to look EXACTLY like mine I suggest MySpace Ad / Annoyance remover, although I don't know what it changes, while making the style I noticed minor differences with it disabled...\r\n\r\nHOTFIX : Changed so the page always has a white background... (Forgot to put !important, silly me!)\r\n\r\nEDIT : Updated style to black and white, cleaned it up, removed borders (Please note it looks different from the screenshot)\r\n\r\nHOTFIX : Fixed how it broke my other customization...\r\n\r\nEDIT : Shortened code\r\n\r\nEDIT : Removed Side of Page ads","user":{"id":2995,"name":"Taeko Hentie","email":"kickass331@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-06-27T15:28:52.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":2496,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/2595_after.gif?r=1678608014","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-06-13T12:51:02.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"myspace","subcategory":"myspace","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.myspace.com\") {\r\n#footer,#additionalcontent,#topnav,#header, #home_additionalLinks, #home_userURLInfo, #home_setHomePage,#home_searchAddressBook,#splash_coolNewPeople,#splash_mainleft,#splash_profile,#home_schools,#home_coolNewVideos,#ctl00_Main_ctl00_ProfileHome_gads,#ctl00_Main_SplashDisplay_ctl01_signUpHyperLink,#home_greybox,#home_featured_music,#home_featured_books,#home_featured_filmmaker,#home_featured_comedy,#ctl00_Main_ctl00_CMS_Tom_Announcement,#ctl00_Main_SplashDisplay_SplashHeader,#ctl00_Main_SplashDisplay_userVideos_VideoToday,#splash_videotoday,#splash_greybox,#ad300x100,#splash_music,#ctl00_Main_SplashDisplay_featuredVideos_CMS_videos,#ctl00_Main_SplashDisplay_CMS_SplashHome_Gads_DE, #splash_mainBottom,#eastgutter,#westgutter {display: none !important;}\r\nbody,#maintable{background-color:#ffffff !important;background:#ffffff !important;width:300px;height:300px}\r\nh1,h2,h3,h4,h5{color:#000000 !important;background-color:#FFFFFF !important;display:none !important}\r\ntable,td,tr,div{background-color:transparent;border:0px !important;}\r\na,a:link,a:visited{border:0px !important;color:#000000 !important;background-color:transparent !important;text-decoration:none !important;}\r\na:hover,a:active{border:0px;color:#CCCCCC !important;background-color:transparent;text-decoration:none !important;}\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":5909,"name":"very nice. my myspace theme is in black. so to me ","rating":3,"created":"2007-07-27T00:14:53.000Z","author_name":"methos","author_id":2314},{"id":6630,"name":"yep, this is a great script!","rating":3,"created":"2007-10-04T10:08:06.000Z","author_name":"frederick szczepanski","author_id":4301},{"id":7273,"name":"nice.
