{"id":2879,"name":"Fastladder - More feeds in Flat view","description":"This style shows more feeds in Flat view without scrolling on Fastladder.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nIf feeds have long title, you cannot see unread count.\r\n\r\nThis style based on http://blog.livedoor.jp/hakin/archives/50833924.html for livedoor Reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n/*\r\nI think Fastladder is the fastest web-based RSS reader.\r\nAnd some tips make it faster for people reading hundreds of feeds.\r\n- Use keyboard shortcuts.\r\n-- For example, S key shows next feed and prefetches next 2 feeds in the background.\r\n- Change some settings.\r\n-- Show only updated feeds: enabled.\r\n-- Number of 'My Feeds' to show: Set limit to 10-20 feeds. (based on your window size)\r\n-- My Feeds view: Flat and Rating.\r\n*/","user":{"id":3328,"name":"shigefumi","email":"shigeshige@gmail.com","paypal_email":"shigefumimemo@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-07-15T09:30:40.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":424,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/2879_after.png?r=1686124815","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-07-15T09:30:40.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"fastladder","subcategory":"fastladder","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http://fastladder.com/reader/) {\r\n    .flat .treeitem {\r\n        height: 1em !important;\r\n        padding-bottom: 8px !important;\r\n    }\r\n/*\r\n    .flat .treeitem { height: auto !important; }\r\n*/\r\n}\r\n","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/2879/fastladder-more-feeds-in-flat-view.user.js","style_settings":[]}
