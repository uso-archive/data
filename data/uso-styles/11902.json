Remember, the closer to 0 you get, the more invisible translucent the menu will be, the closer to 1 you get, the more opaque!   1 is 100% opaque, and web content will not show through, 0 is 0% opaque, and will appear as if the menu is hidden!\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.1\r\n+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-11-26T17:06:01.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":599,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/11902_after.png?r=1533341135","url":"/styles/11902/delicious-transparent-navigation-menus","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/*\r\n ________________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                     |\r\n|          Title:  |  Delicious - Transparent Navigation Menus           |\r\n|    Description:  |  Delicious, even more awesome! trans[arent = Seethru|\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                            |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  November 7, 2008                                   |\r\n|   Last Updated:  |  November 26, 2008                                  |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.1                                            |\r\n|__________________|_____________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(delicious.com) \r\n{\r\n\r\n/* Normal Menu - When Clicked: */\r\n#subnav-list-bookmarks,\r\n#subnav-list-people,\r\n#subnav-listitags,\r\n#global-subnav-list-search,\r\n#viewlistoptions,\r\n#ipplistoptions\r\n{\r\n  opacity: .75 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n/* Hovered Menu - When Moused Over: */\r\n#subnav-list-bookmarks:hover,\r\n#subnav-list-people:hover,\r\n#subnav-listitags:hover,\r\n#global-subnav-list-search:hover\r\n#viewlistoptions:hover,\r\n#ipplistoptions:hover\r\n{\r\n  opacity: .92 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
