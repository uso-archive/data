I thought they were so neat that I wanted to become the CEO of Intel one day! When I was 13 I realized how intriguing websites are so I started to tinker with inspect element. It wasn't until then when I realized what I wanted to do with my life. A few months passed and I was still learning and investing my time away.\r\n\r\nEUREKA! - Finally, by the age of 14, I created my very first website! All front-end and far from perfect, but it was mine that's all that mattered. As time passed, I completed many projects, gradually becoming more educated and working harder as ever.\r\n\r\nAfter hating school for my entire life, when I was 17 in freshmen year, I decided to drop out to pursue my career as a web developer.\r\n\r\nNow I'm fluent in CSS, HTML, JS, Golang, NodeJS, and PHP with a touch of Python and Java (Android Development), currently working as QA and Development at SocialBlade.","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2020-05-20T13:04:22.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":36,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/184020_after.jpeg?r=1687507280","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/184020_additional_36422.jpeg?r=1687507280","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/184020_additional_36423.jpeg?r=1687507280"],"license":null,"created":"2020-05-20T13:04:22.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"deno","subcategory":"deno","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://deno.land/\") {\r\n:root {\r\n\t--border: #262831bd;\r\n\t--background: #313440;\r\n\t--text: #dee2f7;\r\n\t--sidebar: #262831;\r\n\t--sidebar_text: #9ea1b3;\r\n\r\n\t--magenta: #bb7ed7;\r\n\t--red: #d27277;\r\n\t--blue: #74aeea;\r\n\t--yellow: #dfc184;\r\n\t--grey: #acb2be;\r\n\t--green: #a1c181;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://deno.land\") {\r\n.token.keyword,\r\n.token.tag:not(.attr-value):not(.punctuation) {\r\n\tcolor: var(--magenta) !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.token.console {\r\n\tcolor: var(--yellow) !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.token.function {\r\n\tcolor: var(--red) !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.token.punctuation {\r\n\tcolor: var(--blue) !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.token.string,\r\n.token.tag.attr-value {\r\n\tcolor: var(--green) !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.prism-code * {\r\n\tcolor: var(--grey) !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.prism-code {\r\n\tbackground-color: var(--sidebar) !important;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://deno.land\") {\r\n.markdown,\r\n.border-gray-200,\r\n.hover\\:text-gray-600:hover {\r\n\tborder-color: var(--border);\r\n\tcolor: var(--text) !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.text-gray-900 {\r\n\tcolor: var(--sidebar_text);\r\n}\r\n\r\nhtml,\r\nbody {\r\n\tbackground-color: var(--background);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.w-72,\r\n.bg-gray-100,\r\n.prism-code,\r\n.form-select {\r\n\tbackground-color: var(--sidebar) !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.text-gray-700,\r\n.text-gray-900 {\r\n\tcolor: var(--text);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.bg-white {\r\n\tbackground-color: var(--background);\r\n\tcolor: var(--text);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.bg-gray-50 {\r\n\tbackground-color: var(--sidebar);\r\n\tcolor: var(--sidebar_text);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.border-gray-200 {\r\n\tborder-color: var(--border);\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/184020/deno-land-one-dark.user.js","style_settings":[]}
