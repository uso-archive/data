Read the next paragraph:\r\n\r\nI don't know if I'm the only person with this problem, yet wouldn't be surprised. You ever notice those little shadows that deviantART sticks behind deviation thumbnails? Yeah, well, I don't like 'em. They jack up transparent gif files. In your settings you can turn off the shadows site-wide. But, for poor little ole me, the shadows are stuck on no matter how many times I check/uncheck the box and hit OK. That is the reason why this script exists.","user":{"id":4391,"name":"tendron","email":"tendron@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-10-10T12:52:19.000Z","weekly_install_count":2,"total_install_count":720,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3756_after.gif?r=1687593692","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-10-10T12:52:19.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"deviantart","subcategory":"deviantart","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"deviantart.com\") {\r\nspan.shadow {\r\n\tbackground-image: none !important;\r\n\tpadding: 0 !important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/3756/deviantart-shadow-killer.user.js","style_settings":[]}
