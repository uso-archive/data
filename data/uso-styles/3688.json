{"id":3688,"name":"Transw00t? Style Tweak","description":"So you have dancewiththesky's (http://dancewiththesky.deviantart.com/) Transw00t? extension, which lets you translate comments and whatnot from their native language into yours (hopefully).\r\n\r\nI find the feature pretty useful personally, but I've never really felt that it fit in at all.\r\nSo, I decided to fix it.\r\n\r\nIf you're at all familiar with the tweak I made to Mark Recent, then this tweak follows the same styling.\r\nAt present, because the transw00t? box is placed that the bottom of any comment, it is possible, particularly in small width browser windows, that it can overlap signatures and the like. I am working on a solution, but in the mean time, I would advise you don't use the script if you use a screen resolution of less than 1024x768 (then again, I wouldn't suggest using deviantART at all with a resolution less than that).\r\nOf course, if you don't mind (or if you have signatures disabled), then go for it.","user":{"id":2125,"name":"sine-out","email":"lupperton@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-10-04T20:43:40.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":414,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3688_after.png?r=1686470415","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-10-04T20:43:40.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"deviantart","subcategory":"deviantart","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"deviantart.com\") {\r\n\t.transwootTriger{\r\n\t\tposition: absolute;\r\n\t\tbottom: -3px;\r\n\t\tright: -3px;\r\n\t\ttext-align: right;\r\n\t\tfont-size: .8em;\r\n\t\tfont-weight: bold;\r\n\t\tpadding: 3px 5px;\r\n\t\tbackground-color: #92a399 !important;\r\n\t\tmargin: 0;\r\n\t\twidth: 170px !important;\r\n\t}\r\n\t.transwootTriger span{\r\n\t\theight: auto;\r\n\t\tmargin: 0;\r\n\t\tpadding: 0;\r\n\t\tdisplay: block;\r\n\t\ttext-align: center;\r\n\t\twidth: 100% !important;\r\n\t\theight: 100% !important;\r\n\t}\r\n\t.transwootTriger div{\r\n\t\tbackground-color: #92a399 !important;\r\n\t\tcolor: #393c4e !important;\r\n\t\twidth: 180px !important;\r\n\t\tposition: relative;\r\n\t\tleft: 0;\r\n\t}\r\n\t.transwootTriger div ul a{color: #393c4e !important;}\r\n\t.transwootTriger br{display: none;}\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":1226,"name":"compatible?","rating":0,"created":"2008-05-11T22:04:49.000Z","author_name":"maky","author_id":8852}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/3688/transw00t-style-tweak.user.js","style_settings":[]}
