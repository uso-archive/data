{"id":184479,"name":"See the simul host's point of view","description":"Tired of scrolling around to see which game the simul host is looking at? The current game is placed right atop the other games. Also semi-responsive (adapts to the size of the screen, sort of)! The only side effect I've noticed is that completed simuls have a large blank space where the current game board is supposed to go. I'm not sure if I can fix that.","user":{"id":330753,"name":"Seanysean2","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2020-05-31T00:16:45.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":17,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/184479_after.png?r=1678348820","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"ccby","created":"2020-05-31T00:16:45.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"lichess","subcategory":"lichess","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://lichess.org/simul/\") {\r\n    .game-list {\r\n        margin-top: 450px !important;\r\n        position: relative;\r\n    }\r\n    .host {\r\n        padding: 0 !important;\r\n        position: absolute;\r\n        top: -400px;\r\n        left: 50%;\r\n        transform: translateX(-50%);\r\n        width: 304px; /* multiple of 8 */\r\n        height: auto;\r\n        box-shadow: 0 0 0 7px rgba(214,79,0,0.5) !important;\r\n    }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/184479/see-the-simul-host-s-point-of-view.user.js","style_settings":[]}
