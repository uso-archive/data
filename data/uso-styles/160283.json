{"id":160283,"name":"New Gmail Trash Icon Spacing","description":"[Update: As of 6/5/2018, Google added a divider line between the trash icon and the 2 new icons.]\r\n\r\nThe new Gmail has several additional icons after the Trash icon (mark unread and snooze) when viewing an email.  I've added a larger margin between the Trash icon and the next icons to make it easier to navigate and matched to the old Gmail Trash location.","user":{"id":653838,"name":"dwang99","email":"dwang99@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2018-05-21T18:58:58.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":88,"rating":1.0,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/160283_after.jpeg?r=1687593612","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2018-05-21T16:58:32.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://mail.google.com\") {\r\n\r\n.G-Ni\u003e.T-I:nth-child(3) {\r\n    margin-right: 24px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/160283/new-gmail-trash-icon-spacing.user.js","style_settings":[]}
