{"result":{"id":249042,"name":"Fixed Version of Pixel City - Roblox","description":"This is the fixed version of the original, modified with my updated base code.\r\n\r\n<i>Browser Warning: The cost of keeping the quality and speed is that it <strong>won't appear on Microsoft Edge</strong>, a price that I'm willing to pay, switch to any other major browser, copy the CSS code and put into the stylus chrome extension to minimize lag that may be present due to it being animated. </i>\r\n\r\nAll credits go to <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/Seppuku_Doge\" target=\"_blank\">>Kenze Wee - the creator of the artwork<</a> and <a href=\"https://userstyles.org/users/109437\" target=\"_blank\">>Faetalic<</a>, for the colour choices.\r\n\r\nThis code was created by me, do give feedback for improvements in the comments.
