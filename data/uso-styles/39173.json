There isn't a toolbar button for this extension anymore - an icon simply pops up on the navbar for me. The Test Pilot menu has been moved to the Tools menu. The toolbar icon's stretched like crazy for me, so I've modified this style to fix that, but I'm afraid beyond that there's no way to restore the menu to the \"button\" with only CSS (it's not even a button anymore!). I've commented the old code and left it in the style in case people are running an older version which works and still has the traditional button.\r\n\r\n2011.12.03 - The Feedback button doesn't show up for me anymore, even though I have the extension installed. I think this is supposed to be a feature. I'll look into fixing it, but I've had a bunch of stuff break with the latest Firefox update, so may be a while.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n#navigator-toolbox[iconsize=large] #tp-notification-popup-icon {\r\n  padding: 7px 4px 9px 4px !important;\r\n  }\r\n#navigator-toolbox[iconsize=small] #tp-notification-popup-icon {\r\n  padding: 4px 2px 6px 2px !important;\r\n  }\r\n/*[[forceshow]]*/\r\n/* The old code - use this if you're running an older version of Test Pilot that still has a button.
