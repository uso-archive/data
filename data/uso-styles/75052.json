{"id":75052,"name":"Cardfight!! Vanguard Tumblr Icons","description":"A gift for the Cardfight!! Vanguard fandom (Fanguard), which includes a Vanguard Circle as the home button and characters who replace the usual text, photo, quote, link, chat, audio, and video icons. Hope you guys enjoy!\r\n\r\nFeel free to use it as you wish and edit it to your content. No need to credit me or anything, but it'd be nice to.","user":{"id":159575,"name":"Arielel","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://arielel.tumblr.com/","about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2014-02-28T03:14:57.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":237,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/75052_after.png?r=1685865614","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"publicdomain","created":"2012-09-16T18:38:19.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"tumblr","subcategory":"tumblr","additional_info":"☆Update(s)\r\n● (2/27/14): Fixed up the image links since it appears the website that hosted them isn't working properly.
