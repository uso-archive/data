{"id":8188,"name":"Resize Images to Maximum Size when Mouse Hovers","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"style_tags":[],"description":"Hover your mouse over an image, and it will display in its full size.  This only works for images that have been resized in code (example: The preview images of Styles on UserStyles)\r\n\r\n** Thanks goes to user 16 for the Image Resize idea, which is used in the style 127.  I made the code work on Width and Height as well, not just Max-width and Max-Height!!\r\n\r\nTry it out!\r\nOnce you install the Style, head over to the page: Style 7875 and give it a try... Cool hey?\r\n\r\nFunctions:\r\n- When you hover your mouse over an image that has been resized, it will display normally.\r\n\r\nApplies to:\r\n- Any image that has been resized by code\r\n- max-width, preventing a full-width image\r\n- max-height, preventing a full-height image\r\n+ Just hover your mouse cursor over the image, and it will appear in it's original state (100% size, as if you were to save it to your disk.)\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n- Works on Firefox 2\r\n- Works on Firefox 3\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n+ This style works PERFECTLY on Userstyles.org for the Image Previews of the Styles!\r\n+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes!  It has worked perfectly on each.\r\n\r\nExtension Compatability:\r\n** For those of you using the Firefox Extension \"Image Zoom\" please comment or remove the following lines in the code:  \r\n  height: auto !important;\r\n  width: auto !important;\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.4:\r\n+ Code Cleanup, making it function better\r\n+ Added Animated After Image - Use Firefox 3 to view the animation.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.3:\r\n+ Added support for Chrome:// (web pages inside Firefox's configuration) - now works on Extensions such as Brief.\r\n+ Added support for FTP sites.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.2:\r\n+ Added support for Local Files (html files located on local computer hard drive)\r\n\r\n1.0.0.1:\r\n+ Fixed Bug where images that Firefox resized were reacting to the hover sizing.\r\n+ Thanks goes Entirely to user User 347 for reporting the problem, AND producing a fix.  (This update fix was all myf's code)\r\nI thank you for the code, myf, and continual support of my styles.","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-08-01T15:46:31.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":5613,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/8188_after.png?r=1591689941","url":"/styles/8188/resize-images-to-maximum-size-when-mouse-hovers","discussionsCount":6,"commentsCount":6,"css":"/*\r\n ________________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                     |\r\n|          Title:  |  Resize Images to Maximum Size when Mouse Hovers    |\r\n|    Description:  |  Images skewed by using max-width/height are reset  |\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-  and myf collab                            |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  June 20, 2008                                      |\r\n|   Last Updated:  |  Autust 1, 2008                                     |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.4                                            |\r\n|__________________|_____________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document \r\n url-prefix(http://),\r\n url-prefix(https://),\r\n url-prefix(file://),\r\n url-prefix(chrome://)\r\n{\r\n\r\n\r\nhtml > body:not(:only-child) img:hover \r\n{\r\n  max-height: none !important;\r\n  max-width: none !important;\r\n  height: auto !important;\r\n  width: auto !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
