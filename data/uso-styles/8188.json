{"id":8188,"name":"Resize Images to Maximum Size when Mouse Hovers","description":"Hover your mouse over an image, and it will display in its full size.  This only works for images that have been resized in code (example: The preview images of Styles on UserStyles)\r\n\r\n** Thanks goes to user 16 for the Image Resize idea, which is used in the style 127.  I made the code work on Width and Height as well, not just Max-width and Max-Height!!\r\n\r\nTry it out!\r\nOnce you install the Style, head over to the page: Style 7875 and give it a try... Cool hey?\r\n\r\nFunctions:\r\n- When you hover your mouse over an image that has been resized, it will display normally.\r\n\r\nApplies to:\r\n- Any image that has been resized by code\r\n- max-width, preventing a full-width image\r\n- max-height, preventing a full-height image\r\n+ Just hover your mouse cursor over the image, and it will appear in it's original state (100% size, as if you were to save it to your disk.)\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n- Works on Firefox 2\r\n- Works on Firefox 3\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n+ This style works PERFECTLY on Userstyles.org for the Image Previews of the Styles!\r\n+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes!  It has worked perfectly on each.\r\n\r\nExtension Compatability:\r\n** For those of you using the Firefox Extension \"Image Zoom\" please comment or remove the following lines in the code:  \r\n  height: auto !important;\r\n  width: auto !important;\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.4:\r\n+ Code Cleanup, making it function better\r\n+ Added Animated After Image - Use Firefox 3 to view the animation.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.3:\r\n+ Added support for Chrome:// (web pages inside Firefox's configuration) - now works on Extensions such as Brief.\r\n+ Added support for FTP sites.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.2:\r\n+ Added support for Local Files (html files located on local computer hard drive)\r\n\r\n1.0.0.1:\r\n+ Fixed Bug where images that Firefox resized were reacting to the hover sizing.\r\n+ Thanks goes Entirely to user User 347 for reporting the problem, AND producing a fix.  (This update fix was all myf's code)\r\nI thank you for the code, myf, and continual support of my styles.","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"benbenben3@msn.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-08-01T15:46:31.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":5743,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/8188_after.png?r=1687420815","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-06-20T16:28:09.000Z","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n ________________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                     |\r\n|          Title:  |  Resize Images to Maximum Size when Mouse Hovers    |\r\n|    Description:  |  Images skewed by using max-width/height are reset  |\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-  and myf collab                            |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  June 20, 2008                                      |\r\n|   Last Updated:  |  Autust 1, 2008                                     |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.4                                            |\r\n|__________________|_____________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document \r\n url-prefix(http://),\r\n url-prefix(https://),\r\n url-prefix(file://),\r\n url-prefix(chrome://)\r\n{\r\n\r\n\r\nhtml \u003e body:not(:only-child) img:hover \r\n{\r\n  max-height: none !important;\r\n  max-width: none !important;\r\n  height: auto !important;\r\n  width: auto !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":9008,"name":"Nice idea.\n\nI do want to point out that this dis","rating":3,"created":"2008-06-20T17:08:43.000Z","author_name":"USBman","author_id":1340},{"id":9017,"name":"Really nice idea. \nI made variation that tries to","rating":3,"created":"2008-06-22T08:33:33.000Z","author_name":"myf","author_id":347},{"id":9288,"name":"Greatly apreciated!","rating":3,"created":"2008-07-07T14:47:12.000Z","author_name":"Chiribaka","author_id":12130},{"id":9381,"name":"The original size image may - and often does - str","rating":3,"created":"2008-07-11T15:23:28.000Z","author_name":"makondo","author_id":169},{"id":10891,"name":"i like this, but since i use image zoom, i deleted","rating":3,"created":"2008-11-09T11:02:10.000Z","author_name":"coreywho","author_id":16551},{"id":11099,"name":"I notice that when I use this, when the image resi","rating":3,"created":"2008-11-27T05:15:14.000Z","author_name":"brightside","author_id":17047}],"discussionsCount":6,"commentsCount":6,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/8188/resize-images-to-maximum-size-when-mouse-hovers.user.js","style_settings":[]}
