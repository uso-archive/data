{"id":29644,"name":"Google - clean it up a bit","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","style_tags":[],"description":"Ok, this is my personal customization of Google search. Any bug that you find, please report it here. It will probably not work if you don't use an ad blocker (Adblock Plus is fantastic, try it). Here's what this does:\r\n\r\n- widens the search results so they occupy the entire page to the right;\r\n- removes the underlining from links, except when the mouse is over them;\r\n- adds a little shadow to the links (it looks a bit strange in the menus, but they're rarely used and it doesn't look that bad, and everywhere else it looks leaner);\r\n- makes the ellipsis larger and more noticeable so it's really obvious when the preview text is cut;\r\n- removes random junk that's probably not important to you (not to me it isn't);\r\n- centers the footer in the results page.\r\n\r\nNo screen shots, sorry. It's easy to preview, so it's not much of an issue.","user":{"id":26762,"name":"Morbus","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-05-26T07:03:04.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":746,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":null,"url":"/styles/29644/google-clean-it-up-a-bit","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.google.com\") {#cnt, .s  { max-width:100% !important; }\r\na, u { text-decoration: none !important; text-shadow: #ddd 1px 1px !important; }\r\na:hover, u:hover { text-decoration: underline !important; }\r\n.spell { font-size: 0.9em !important; }\r\ndiv#res.med div ol li { border-width: 0 0 1px 0 !important; border-color: #C9D7F1 !important; border-style: solid !important; padding-bottom: 15px !important;}\r\n#fll { display:none !important; }\r\n.tbpo, .tbpc { text-decoration: none !important; }\r\n.tbpo:hover, .tbpc:hover { text-decoration: underline !important; }\r\np#ofr, div#bsf p, p#flp { font-size: 10px !important; line-height: 11px !important;}\r\nli.g div.s b { color: #bbb !important; font-size: 30px !important; line-height: 0 !important; font-family: calibri, serif !important; font-weight: normal !important; padding: 0 5px !important; }\r\nli.g div.s cite b { color: inherit !important; font-size: inherit !important; line-height: inherit  !important; font-family: inherit !important; font-weight: bold !important; padding: 0 !important; }\r\ndiv#center_col { margin-right: 0px !important; }\r\ninput.lst { padding: 2px 10px 2px 6px !important; }\r\n#foot { margin: 0 auto !important; padding: 0 0 25px !important; }\r\np#bfl { margin-top: 20px !important; }\r\ndiv#ss-status { margin-left: -190px !important;}\r\n\r\n}"}
