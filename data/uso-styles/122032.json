{"result":{"id":122032,"name":"YouTube Real Cinema Mode","description":"Don't like these small videos on YouTube pages? Me too. So one day I decided to change that and created this userstyle.\r\n<br><strong>This style expands video to fill all free space inside the browser window. Like a fullscreen YouTube but not fullscreen. You'll like it!</strong>\r\n<br>Scroll YouTube page down to see comments and other stuff.\r\nMove the cursor up and the top bar with the search will appear.\r\n<br>It also shows a floating miniplayer in the corner when you read comments. You can disable this in options if you don't like it.","category":"site","url":"/styles/122032/youtube-real-cinema-mode","created":"2015-12-18T17:01:32.000Z","updated":"2023-10-13T02:38:46.000Z","rating":3.9,"screenshotUrl":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/122032_after.jpeg?r=1698307292","user":{"name":"HorsyNox","paypalEmail":null,"id":666643,"photoUrl":null},"subcategory":"youtube","isPremium":false,"weeklyInstallsCount":87,"totalInstallsCount":292065,"md5":"f5df40af4ef42a06c33d7e21cf36ea8f","notes":"<strong>If you have any suggestions for improvement of this userstyle please leave a feedback message.</strong>\r\n___________\r\n<strong>Changelog:</strong>\r\n<em>13 oct 2023</em> - Added the Auto Scrollbar option that shows the scrollbar in the comments section and pages without the player but hides it when the big \"theater\" player is on screen.\r\n<em>5 oct 2023</em> - Added optional floating miniplayer in comments section.\r\n<em>25 aug 2023</em> - Added automatic top menu display on scroll for new browsers that support this feature.\r\n<em>22 aug 2023</em> - Every day something new.
