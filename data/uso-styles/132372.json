I believe in going beyond and exceeding the limits of the boundaries of the experiences for websites. It it can be improved, performance or graphics, I believe people have that right to experience it. If you don't prefer my themes at the end, I hope inspiration has. Depending on the theme, such as Google or YouTube, some themes may become outdated and replaced entirely due to the constant evolution of some sites, but they will remain for public use.\r\n\r\nhttp://youtube.com/computerarea\r\nhttp://fb.me/computeradvanced\r\nhttp://fb.me/thecomputerarea\r\nhttp://twitter.com/computerarea","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2016-09-05T19:54:24.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":695,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/132372_after.png?r=1687420883","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/132372_additional_21924.png?r=1687420883"],"license":null,"created":"2016-09-05T19:54:24.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"1337x","subcategory":"1337x","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"1337x.to\") {\r\n  .featured-box .tab-detail ul li{background:#222}\r\n  .featured-box .tab-detail ul li:nth-child(2n){background:#2f2f2f}\r\n  .featured-box .tab-detail ul li a{color:#999!important}\r\n    .featured-box .tab-detail ul li span{color:#999!important}\r\n  .featured-box .top-row{background: #444}\r\n  .featured-box .heading-box{background: #555}\r\n  .featured-box .tab-detail ul li strong a b {}\r\n  header{filter: grayscale(100%);}\r\n  .heading-row{filter: grayscale(100%);}\r\n  .list-box ul{filter: grayscale(100%);background:#222;color:#999 !important}\r\n  .list-box ul a{color:#999 !important}\r\n  .pagging-box{background:#222;box-shadow: none}\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":52094,"name":"Not working on main list.","rating":0,"created":"2016-10-21T05:08:02.000Z","author_name":"Martin Natale","author_id":321820},{"id":61846,"name":"Update Please","rating":2,"created":"2017-11-27T04:03:35.000Z","author_name":"Verelon Proton","author_id":557775}],"discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/132372/1337x-to-simple-dark.user.js","style_settings":[]}
