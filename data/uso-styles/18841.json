{"id":18841,"name":"ESPN Streak - Remove Social Bluffs","description":"ESPN Streak is a sports game where you try to pick the winners of sporting contests and propositions posted by the service provider.  The goal is to build up the longest winning streak.  One of the features of the game is the information provided about the picks of other players (and there are hundreds of thousands).  Knowing what percentage of the players are choosing one side, or another, or which contest is currently drawing the most votes seems like it would be useful information.  But actually, it's a trap, similar to a bluff in poker or similar card games.  It encourages herd-thinking, and increases a player's likelihood of picking sucker contests.  This UserStyle removes the information that shows the social information from the interface, so the player can just focus on picking contests or props in which they have better knowledge or hunches.","user":{"id":24942,"name":".LAG","email":"larrygreen@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-06-19T13:12:03.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":224,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/18841_after.gif?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-06-19T13:12:03.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"go","subcategory":"go","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url(\"http://streak.espn.go.com/entry\") {\r\n\r\n.mg-column6, .mg-column7 { display: none; }\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/18841/espn-streak-remove-social-bluffs.user.js","style_settings":[]}
