{"id":1307,"name":"GMail New \"Forward All\" Feature Hilite","description":"Gmail just added something I've wanted for a long time - the ability to forward all messages in a conversation at once.  Hooray!  Perhaps due to my over-exhuberance (GOD I love GMail!),  I've made that \"far right menu option\" stand out in bold red.  I believe the div[class=\"ar'} would apply to all items in that list, but I just wanted \"Forward All\" to stand out.\r\n\r\nYou can obviously change the font size/color (MOST of you will!  Ha ha!) below; this is just my preference.","user":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","paypal_email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2006-11-10T10:04:27.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1017,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/1307_after.png?r=1677312015","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-11-10T10:04:27.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n/*Coded by Paulfox Nov 10th 2006 10AM Ver 1.1*/\r\n@-moz-document domain(mail.google.com) {[id=\"fthd\"] {color:red!important; font-size:14pt!important; font-weight:bold!important}}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/1307/gmail-new-forward-all-feature-hilite.user.js","style_settings":[]}
