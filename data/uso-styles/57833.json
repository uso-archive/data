{"id":57833,"name":"Longecity.org - Left Column Removal","description":"Removes the left column, which is annoying with small displays. Even with 1024 in width, you have to scroll to the right to read the posts.\r\nSo even while just being a lurker on the noot' forum, I created this to be able to read more efficiently.\r\nThey should have made the column as a separately loaded script instead of being in the main file, then it could be blocked using Adblock Plus... Or just scrap it and use a horizontal menu at the top.","user":{"id":126362,"name":"luminatus","email":"mr_luminatus@hotmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2012-01-19T05:19:25.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":103,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/57833-after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2011-12-11T14:04:04.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"longecity","subcategory":"longecity","additional_info":"Version 1.0.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/*Made by Luminatus.
