{"id":106289,"name":"@about:newtab: patch / fix for firefox 33+","description":"Quick fix for \u003ccode\u003eabout:newtab\u003c/code\u003e page on Firefox 33 and above for users who were using more rows and columns of tiles than Firefox currently allows.\r\n\r\nFirefox 33 wrecked the newtab page with its fixed-size, one-size-for-everyone tiles.  There is no way to set the row and column count in \u003ccode\u003eabout:config\u003c/code\u003e.  This userstyle attempts to undo some of this by displaying smaller tiles so they can all be displayed.  Also: userstyles that attempt to circumvent this by having scrollable or full-height tile-grid will likely have severe issues with being able to drag/drop tiles (everything appears to get buggy/wrecked).  This userstyle so far does not appear to have this issue; Drag and drop works fine.","user":{"id":147013,"name":"jongo","email":"jonzergu68remote@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2015-04-08T02:26:47.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":2016,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/106289_after.jpeg?r=1687075281","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2014-10-15T03:43:04.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":"v.1.00: release (2014-10-14).\r\nv.1.01: re-display \u003ccode\u003e#newtab-margin-undo-container\u003c/code\u003e (it didn't need to be hidden) (2014-10-15)\r\nv.1.02: show current logo to differentiate what browser release (firefox/beta/aurora) is currently running.  sometimes hard to tell :) (2014-12-20)\r\nv.1.03: fix for FFx39 (bottom margin of cells)  (2015-04-07)","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url(\"about:newtab\") {\r\n  #newtab-grid \u003e .newtab-cell{\r\n    height: 65px;\r\n    width: 135px;\r\n  }\r\n  #newtab-grid{\r\n    height: unset !important;\r\n    max-height: unset !important;\r\n    max-width: unset !important;\r\n  }\r\n  #newtab-grid{\r\n    margin: 0 2ex 2ex 2ex !important;\r\n    padding: 2ex;\r\n    background-color: hsla(240, 20%, 85%, 1.0);\r\n  }\r\n  #newtab-grid, .newtab-cell{\r\n    border: 1px solid navy;\r\n  }\r\n  #newtab-search-container{\r\n    margin-left: 1in;\r\n    margin-right: 1in;\r\n  }\r\n  #newtab-margin-top, #newtab-margin-bottom, .newtab-side-margin{\r\n    display:none;\r\n  }\r\n  #newtab-margin-undo-container{}\r\n\r\n  /*v.1.02: show the current browser logo (i.e., firefox/beta/aurora)*/\r\n  #newtab-scrollbox{\r\n    background-image: url(\"chrome://branding/content/about-logo.png\");\r\n    background-attachment: fixed;\r\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n    background-size: 9%;\r\n    background-position: 50% 0%;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /*fix for change in FFx 39*/\r\n  .newtab-cell{\r\n    margin-bottom: 20px;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n","discussions":[{"id":44012,"name":"Just a question","rating":3,"created":"2014-10-20T00:55:45.000Z","author_name":"Shadow_Reaper","author_id":276251}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
