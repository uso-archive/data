{"id":3307,"name":"MySpace Home Cleanz0rz (High customizability)","description":"MySpace Home Cleanz0rz is an effective way to clean up your mySpace Home. It is very easely customizable, as you will see in the code. Also, it does a neat little thing to the InfoBox (that thingwith your profile views in it). I created this userstyle because I wasn't happy with any of the other MySpace Home ones available. I guess no one will ever be happy with any preset for his or her MySpace Home, that's why I made sure this one is easely editable.\r\n\r\nOh, and for the heck of it, check out my profile!\r\nhttp://www.myspace.com/r0bsp03l\r\n\r\nHere is a link to a high resolution screenshot:\r\nhttp://img183.imageshack.us/img183/3013/screenafterbqa1.png\r\n\r\n[Update #1]\r\nAdded more switchable sections.\r\nMySpace Tom's announcements should now be showed by default\r\nHide \"powered by Google\"\r\n\r\n[Update #2]\r\nAdded a switch for the Profile Options (Classic/New).\r\nRehid \"powered by Google\" and the search bar.\r\nResized the big blue header so it looks better.\r\n\u003e @EdenResident, I couldn't find the \"Your Network\" box you are mentioning, could you please provide a screenshot? I'll be glad to get rid of it for you :)\r\n\r\n[Update #3]\r\nHid Friend Updates by default. You can display them again by uncommenting the correct line of code as described.\r\n\u003e @yestergray, I can't find that box, maybe MySpace has removed it by now :)","user":{"id":3866,"name":"robz0rz","email":"robz0rz_@hotmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-12-28T03:46:40.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":1677,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3307_after.png?r=1687420883","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-08-30T17:17:50.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"myspace","subcategory":"myspace","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n * MySpace Home Cleanz0rz\r\n * By robz0rz\r\n *\r\n */\r\n \r\n /* ************ *\r\n  *  Easy edit!  *\r\n  * ************ */\r\n /*\r\n  * If you want to hide/unhide a section in your MySpace Home,\r\n  * you just have to uncomment/comment out the proper line in\r\n  * this file.\r\n  * eg.
