{"id":24696,"name":"Hide Tumblr Dashboard footer","description":"When you have the Endless Scroll setting on and you mouse over the bottom 50px or so of the screen on your Tumblr dashboard, a footer pops up under your mouse with links to About, Meetups, Content Policy, ToS, etc. I find this annoying, because I end up being redirected to pages when I am really wanting to click a link in a post I'm reading, or just clicking on the page to focus the window, etc. All this script does is hide that footer from popping up.","user":{"id":15308,"name":"buddyjcat","email":"riamnda@gmail.com","paypal_email":"riamnda@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2010-01-30T01:35:39.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":717,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":null,"obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-01-30T01:35:39.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"tumblr","subcategory":"tumblr","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url(\"http://www.tumblr.com/dashboard\") , url(\"https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard\") {\r\n\r\ndiv#footer {display:none !important; visibility: hidden !important;}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/24696/hide-tumblr-dashboard-footer.user.js","style_settings":[]}
