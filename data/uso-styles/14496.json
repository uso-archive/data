{"id":14496,"name":"Gmail - Large Labels and Move To menus","description":"In February of 2009, Gmail introduced new style buttons and new \"Labels\" and \"Move To\" menus that lets you apply multiple labels faster and label and archive e-mails with just 2 clicks. The maximum height of these menus is 200 pixels, so if you use a lot of labels you have to scroll down the list. This script changes that maximum height to 500 pixels, making it faster to apply labels to e-mails if you use a lot of labels.\r\n\r\nMore info on this new feature here: http://lifehacker.com/5145527/gmail-adds-new-move-to-and-labels-drop+downs-autocomplete\r\n\r\nR.I.P. Scrollbars!\r\n\r\nUpdated March 6th, 2009 - CSS code changed in Gmail... Should be fine now.","user":{"id":11828,"name":"ivand87","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-03-06T08:44:56.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":861,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/14496_after.png?r=1684742413","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-02-04T04:16:03.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document \r\n\r\ndomain(\"mail.google.com\")\r\n{\r\n.goog-menu-content { max-height: 500px !important; }\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":24079,"name":"doesn't seem to work","rating":0,"created":"2010-12-19T08:01:53.000Z","author_name":"eligator","author_id":53326}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/14496/gmail-large-labels-and-move-to-menus.user.js","style_settings":[]}
