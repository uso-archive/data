{"id":148949,"name":"Habitica Collapse Drawers Until Hover","description":"Collapses Habitica action bars/drawers (on the bottom of the Skills, Equipment, and Stable pages) until hovered over. Also makes them semi-transparent until hovered over so they're less obtrusive. Similar to the Default Collapsed Drawers style, except the other style causes food not to show up on the Stable page.","user":{"id":518210,"name":"sonnet73","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"updated":"2017-11-10T03:46:28.000Z","weekly_install_count":5,"total_install_count":1146,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/148949_after.png?r=1687593692","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2017-10-01T00:03:00.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"habitica","subcategory":"habitica","additional_info":"Update: Added fade animation; drawer no longer collapses when the pointer hovers over a tooltip inside the drawer","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"habitica.com\")\r\n{\r\n  .drawer-container:not(:hover)\r\n  {\r\n    opacity: 0.5;\r\n    height: 34px;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .drawer-container\r\n  {\r\n    transition: opacity 0.75s;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .drawer-container .popover\r\n  {\r\n    pointer-events: none;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .drawer-toggle-icon\r\n  {\r\n    display: none;\r\n  }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/148949/habitica-collapse-drawers-until-hover.user.js","style_settings":[]}
