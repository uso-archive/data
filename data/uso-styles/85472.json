{"id":85472,"name":"Dark Mangayes","description":"Another dark skin, this time for popular comic site \"Mangayes.\"  Unlike traditional Dark skins that I make, this one doesn't reskin the ENTIRE site, but instead the background when reading comics.  The front page panes are still bright-ish in colours, because the default colours have a nicer tone to them.  The contract against the black background is very nice, however.","user":{"id":117945,"name":"Ix","email":"emhilradim@hotmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"updated":"2013-04-02T21:41:26.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":53,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/85472-after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2013-04-02T21:41:26.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"mangayes","subcategory":"mangayes","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"mangayes.com\") {\r\nbody {background: none #000 !important; color: #fff;}\r\n.foot {background: none #222 !important; color:#fff;}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/85472/dark-mangayes.user.js","style_settings":[]}
