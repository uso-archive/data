This userstyle sadly won't work in other browsers. I'm a Chrome user, so I dearly wish Chrome had this functionality. I now use Firefox whenever I do Duolingo just for this reason, as the Japanese courses are much nicer with this. ^^\r\n\r\nYou possibly may need to disable this userstyle when doing other courses on Duolingo. It shouldn't affect anything for most courses, but there's a good chance it might try to toggle some Korean and Chinese IME's on and off unwantedly.\r\n\r\nJapanese IME's remember their last output mode. If it doesn't seem like the userstyle is working, check that your output mode isn't set to half-width alphanumeric on Japanese typing questions.\r\n\r\nHope people like this userstyle. ^^","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document regexp(\"^https:\\\\/\\\\/www\\\\.duolingo\\\\.com\\\\/(practice|skill\\\\/(ja|en)\\\\/.+\\\\/(practice|test|\\\\d+)|bigtest\\\\/(ja|en)\\\\/\\\\d+|placement\\\\/(ja|en))$\") {\r\n/*\r\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n!!!
