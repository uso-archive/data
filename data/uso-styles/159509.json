(Any version of it is fine.)\r\n  - Make sure you keep your keyboard on Japanese IME at all times. Don't manually switch to another keyboard/language (i.e. English)!\r\n  - Depending on your setup, you may also need to switch to hiragana output at the start too.　Shouldn't be set to half-width alphanumeric.\r\n  - I've only tested this for Microsoft Japanese IME and Google Japanese Input (both in Windows 10).\r\n  - FIREFOX is the only major web browser which currently supports the CSS3 \"ime-mode\" property needed for this userstyle to work.\r\n*/\r\n\r\ntextarea[placeholder=\"Type in English\"],\r\ninput[placeholder=\"Type in English\"],\r\ntextarea[placeholder=\"英語で入力してください\"],\r\ninput[placeholder=\"英語で入力してください\"] {\r\n\time-mode: disabled;\r\n    /*ime-mode: inactive;*/\r\n}\r\n\r\ntextarea[placeholder=\"Type in Japanese\"],\r\ninput[placeholder=\"Type in Japanese\"],\r\ntextarea[placeholder=\"日本語で入力してください\"],\r\ninput[placeholder=\"日本語で入力してください\"] {\r\n    ime-mode: active;\r\n}\r\n}"}
