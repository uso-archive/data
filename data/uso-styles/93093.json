{"id":93093,"name":"Web of Trust browser interface enhancements","description":"Web of Trust, better known as WOT is a crowdsourcing service designed to offer other people's experience with websites, so you can be better informed about where you go on the internet. While the WOT button is enough for most people, this style allows you to see the trustworthiness of a website simply by glancing at the active tab, or by seeing the address bar -- The border will change colors to also tell you the trustworthiness of a website.","user":{"id":15989,"name":"there.is.only.xul","email":"bluufoxx@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2013-09-18T18:18:13.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":183,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/93093_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2013-09-18T17:52:30.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":"Prerequisites:\r\nWOT browser extension.

His version of the style that colors the URL bar background and tab text (instead of the behavior demonstrated here) can be found \u003ca href=http://userstyles.org/styles/93124/\u003ehere!\u003c/a\u003e\r\n- Remove all instances of :not if you want the address bar to always show website reputation.\r\n- Making the border thicker will reposition icons in the URL bar. Adjust with caution.\r\n- Settings for unknown reputation reflect what I believed was ideal for the stock theme. Remove the unknown block if you don't want to see that, or have other code that supersedes these settings.\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n- Why not color the address bar? There are too many styles that do this already, and I am accounting for users of addons that add a progress bar within the address bar. PLus, it looks more elegant and doesn't clutter the interface.\r\n- Only the active tab shows reputation; It's a WOT limitation I cannot work around for now.\r\n- The colors for each reputation tier goes as follows for tab text shadow and address border:\r\nExcellent: Light green / Light green\r\nGood: Green-yellow / Green-yellow\r\nUnsatisfactory: Gold / Gold (used because it's more eye-friendly than pure yellow)\r\nPoor: Dark orange / Dark orange\r\nVery poor: Red / Red\r\nUnknown: Grey / Black (Grey used since it's more readable in the tab)\r\n- \u003ci\u003e09/27/13\u003c/i\u003e I released a \u003ca href=http://userstyles.org/styles/93454\u003ecompanion style\u003c/a\u003e for this which may prove beneficial for users of this style.\r\n\r\nStandard behavior for hovering over the address bar and making it active by clicking on the input box has remained unaltered through the use of :not selectors. as to not tamper too much with the default theme.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n09/18/13; Initial release\r\n\r\nPlanned changes:\r\nIf I get around to it, changing the color of the address bar background to reflect the security of a website.","style_tags":[],"css":"/* WOT - Text shadow and URL bar based on trustworthiness\r\n\r\nMade by LuckyMouse, modified by there.is.only.xul\r\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n+Any copyright is dedicated to the Public Domain. +\r\n+http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/+\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nModify to preference.
