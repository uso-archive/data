{"id":31403,"name":"Google Voice - Hide \"Do Not Disturb\" Notice","description":"I leave Google Voice in \"do not disturb\" mode all the time, since I do not use it for call screening; once my normal number hands it off to my Google Voice number, I want it to go to voicemail as quickly as possible.  This merely hides the \"'do not disturb' is on\" notice, since I always expect it to be on and it can be distracting from other messages Google Voice might be displaying in the same area.","user":{"id":2444,"name":"WCityMike","email":"mikeharris19@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"updated":"2010-06-06T00:06:38.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":249,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":null,"obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-06-06T00:06:38.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.google.com/voice\"), url-prefix(\"https://www.google.com/voice\") {\r\n#gc-dnd-display, .gc-dnd-display\r\n{\r\ndisplay: none !important\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/31403/google-voice-hide-do-not-disturb-notice.user.js","style_settings":[]}
