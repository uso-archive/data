{"id":26643,"name":"Separe-like blank tab dividers (vertical-friendly)","description":"The Separe addon for Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1945) is an addon that highlights blank tabs such that they can serve as simple dividers between groups of tabs, e.g. between work and leisure, you could put a blank tab.\r\n\r\nThe addon is no longer supported, and a few Stylish replacements have been made including http://userstyles.org/styles/2033 and http://userstyles.org/styles/1615.\r\n\r\nI use the tree-style tab addon (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5890) which stacks tabs vertically, but neither of the Stylish Separe replacements interacted well with the vertically-oriented tabs.  So I modded one of them so it works with the vertical tabs.  I don't know anything about CSS, so it was literally trial and error, and as such, I can't make any guarantees it will work on your system, but it does work for me...  My changes are trivial, so all credit to the previous authors.","user":{"id":45333,"name":"traycerb","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2010-03-24T23:44:54.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":153,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/26643_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-03-24T23:44:54.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\ntab[label=\"(Untitled)\"] {\r\nmargin-left: 0px !important;\r\nmargin-right: 0px !important;\r\npadding-right: 0px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntab[label=\"(Untitled)\"] \u003e hbox,\r\ntab[label=\"(Untitled)\"] \u003e .tab-close-button {\r\n  background-color: #FF9900 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntab[label=\"(Untitled)\"] .tab-text,\r\ntab[label=\"(Untitled)\"] \u003e .tab-close-button,\r\ntab[label=\"(Untitled)\"] .tab-icon {\r\n  display: none !important;\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
