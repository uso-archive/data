{"id":8414,"name":"Rounded Menus Popups (WellRounded) Firefox 3 (WOW)","description":"Gives you Rounded Edges on all menus, poups and toolbar drop-downs.\r\n\r\n* Thanks to user 5424 for introducing me into the \"Wellrounded\" types of styling with style 8366\r\n\r\nThis makes your menus look really cool, and utilizes some of Firefox 3's latest features.\r\nThis style supports only Firefox3, giving it even more of a WOW effect!.\r\n\r\nApplies to:\r\n+ File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Tools and Help menus\r\n+ Navigation Toolbar (example: right clicking on back button)\r\n+ Main Context Menu (Right clicking on any web page)\r\n+ Right-Clicking on a tab (rounds the menus)\r\n+ Right-Clicking on the Location Bar (address bar)\r\n+ Also Applies to EVERY single menu on any window of a popup or pane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n+ Uses new CSS3 Circular Radius Supercode!\r\n+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes! Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has rounded perfectly on each.\r\n* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n+ Works only on Firefox3\r\n\r\nIntegrates with the following Styles:\r\n+ Style 9214\r\n+ Style 8410\r\n+ Style 8818\r\n+ Style 8028\r\n+ Style 8320\r\n\r\n\r\nWorks well with:\r\n+ All of the Well Rounded styles\r\n+ The Styles Displayed above\r\n\r\nAbout:Screenshots:\r\n- The After Screenshot is now an Animated PNG, showing you all of the possible customizations you can make to the corners of your menus.  The default is the section of the animation that displays the longest (The max-curve you can have)\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.5:\r\n+ Fixed bug that made menu selector \"rounded\" when hovering.  Also fixed bug where compressed menus were appearing on hover.\r\n+ To make the selector rounded, use this style 9214\r\n\r\n1.0.0.4:\r\n+ Fixed bug that made the menus tiny and compressed.  For those of you who liked the menus this way, I left a comment in the code so you can revert back to tiny menus.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.3:\r\n+ Fixed all problems with the style, as you reported.\r\n+ Rounding should now occur on all operating systems and versions of Firefox!\r\n\r\n1.0.0.2:\r\n+ Added code to force rounding if another style is causing the menus to not round\r\n+ This update should fix the \"Not Working\" bug, Please let me know in the Forums.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.1:\r\n+ Code Cleanup.","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"benbenben3@msn.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-12-16T20:20:46.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":6030,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/8414_after.png?r=1675238412","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-06-27T14:05:16.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                    |\r\n|          Title:  |  Rounded Menus Popups (WellRounded) Firefox 3      |\r\n|    Description:  |  Rounded Edges on all menus WOW                    |\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                           |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  June 27, 2008                                     |\r\n|   Last Updated:  |  December 16, 2008                                 |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.5                                           |\r\n|__________________|____________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npopup:not(#autoscroller), menupopup \r\n{\r\n  -moz-border-radius: 19px !important;\r\n  border-collapse: separate !important;\r\n  -moz-appearance: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nmenubar \u003e menu, menupopup \u003e menu, popup \u003e menu, menuitem, toolbarbutton,popup:not(#autoscroller)\r\n{ \r\n  -moz-border-radius: 19px !important;\r\n  border-collapse: separate !important;\r\n  /* Remove the following comment to revert back to tiny menus: */\r\n  /* -moz-appearance: none !important; */\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#contentAreaContextMenu menuitem[disabled=\"true\"],\r\n#contentAreaContextMenu menuitem[disabled=\"true\"] + menuseparator,\r\nmenuitem[disabled=\"true\"]\r\n{ \r\n  /* display: none !important; */\r\n  -moz-border-radius: 19px !important;\r\n  border-collapse: separate !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmenupopup \u003e menu[_moz-menuactive=\"true\"],\r\nmenupopup \u003e menuitem[_moz-menuactive=\"true\"],\r\npopup \u003e menu[_moz-menuactive=\"true\"],\r\npopup \u003e menuitem[_moz-menuactive=\"true\"] \r\n{\r\n  -moz-border-radius: 19px !important;\r\n  border-collapse: separate !important;\r\n  /* -moz-appearance: none !important; */\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":8858,"name":"does not work no matter what I try.","rating":1,"created":"2008-07-15T18:16:32.000Z","author_name":"bugmenot123","author_id":2921},{"id":9566,"name":"This is just outstanding!!!
