This will make them think you are on a old-fashioned and boring-to-death and work-related website. You may need to change it to a custom one (grey, white...) to a more corporate one.\r\n\r\nAll images are by default in grey and black and almost transparent. Picture will appear with full opacity  but sill in B\u0026W if your mouse is over them only. This feature reduce the capability of a prying eye to deduce anything in your disadvantage.\r\n \r\nThis feature is also to stop the usual suspicious behaviour (ALt+TAB) of the culprit which is a major hint that you were not working.","user":{"id":287794,"name":"tafounast","email":"menosnt@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2016-11-25T17:22:22.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":234,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/135625_after.png?r=1679817613","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/135625_additional_23263.png?r=1679817613","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/135625_additional_23264.png?r=1679817613"],"license":null,"created":"2016-11-25T17:16:09.000Z","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http)  {\r\n    \r\n    /*all images (97% in real) are in grey\u0026 black to deceive eye prying detection pattern website pattern: blue-\u003efacebook, red-\u003eyoutube... ;)\r\n    opacity reduce to the minimum so only you can see them\r\n    */\r\n    img {filter: grayscale(100%);opacity:0.1;}\r\n    \r\n    /*\r\n    Images appear briefly but still Black and white only the mouse is over the picture and\r\n    */\r\n    img:hover {opacity:1;}\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    /*uniform \u0026 boring background-\u003e you are working ;)\r\n    */\r\n    * {\r\n    background-color: #D4D0C8 !important;\r\n    color: black !important;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    a:link {text-decoration: underline !important;}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/135625/hide-my-ass.user.js","style_settings":[]}
