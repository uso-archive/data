{"id":18389,"name":"Xbox360Achievements.org Wide Minimal","description":"I was experiencing some problems with elements on the site overlapping, particularly on the Achievement Guide pages, plus the big margins on the left \u0026 right sides kinda bugged me. This makes the main content portion of the site span the entire browser window, as opposed to an absolute 1000 pixels. I also removed the useless top banner graphic. Finally, because the resizing causes the graphics to go even more out of alignment, I simply removed all the background graphics and changed the background to simple white. This is my first Stylish script and I used it as an opportunity to start teaching myself about how CSS works :) I might make a better version at some point, but for now it works fine.\r\n\r\nNote that the advertising on this site is not present in my screenshots thanks to AdBlock Plus.","user":{"id":24261,"name":"Patrick Simonds","email":"divinitycycle@gmail.com","paypal_email":"divinitycycle@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-05-31T21:20:26.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":213,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/18389_after.gif?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-05-31T21:20:26.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"xbox360achievements","subcategory":"xbox360achievements","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"xbox360achievements.org\") {\r\nbody #main_container{\r\n\twidth:100%!important;\r\n\tbackground-image:none!important;\r\n\tbackground-color: white!important;\r\n}\r\n#container_head{\r\n\twidth:100%!important;\r\n\theight:0px!important;\r\n\tbackground-color: white!important;\r\n}\r\n.header {\r\n\tbackground-image:none!important;\r\n\twidth:100%!important;\r\n\tmargin-left:0px!important;\r\n\theight:0px!important;\r\n\tbackground-color: white!important;\r\n}\r\n.head_menu {\r\n\tbackground-image:none!important;\r\n\twidth:100%!important;\r\n\theight:0px!important;\r\n\tmargin-left:0px!important;\r\n\tbackground-color: white!important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbody { background-image: none!important;\r\n\tbackground-color: white!important;\t\r\n}\r\n.content {\r\n\tbackground-image:none!important;\r\n\tbackground-color: white!important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/18389/xbox360achievements-org-wide-minimal.user.js","style_settings":[]}
