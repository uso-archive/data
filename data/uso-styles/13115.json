This style removes the unnecessary drop-down, simply left-click on the icon to see the drop-down list.  Without the style had to insert spaces into toolbar to left and above the icon.\r\n\r\nThe Launchy extension can be installed from https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/81 and can be used to bring up the current page in another application, such as another browser  (IE, Opera),  or editor (Notepad).\r\n\r\nFirefox Customizations (Notes)] Launchy Notes, opening Notepad and other applications\r\n-  http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/firefox.htm#launchy_notes \r\n\r\nExample of launchy.xml file \r\n- http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/code/launchy.txt  \r\n\r\nPicture from  Launchy button, Tools menu, or Context menu with web page as the object the items with an asterisk (*) and a number are those that I added specifically for my own applications and Firefox profiles, the rest were found by the extension itself.
