This style hides:\r\n\r\n\u003e The Google logo above the searchbar\r\n\u003e The Google Chrome advert at the upper right\r\n\u003e The Google Nexus ad at the bottom of the search bar\r\n\r\nOn hover, these elements will fade in to be seen. It is done like this out of respect for Google's right to advertise, yet with that right they clutter the search page. Also a good way to hide doodles -- provided I have the right class for them.
