{"id":9349,"name":"Navigation/Location Bar Minimal Height","description":"The idea here is to use minimum real estate used for  the Navigation Toolbar,  and other toolbars, so that you have more screen space to use your browser for it's intended purpose of looking at web pages not space hogging graphics.   This style uses roughly about 1/3 of the height of the original toolbar.    The red outline is the Navigation Toolbar itself and is the most wasteful of the toolbars. \r\n \r\nThis is one of several styles to minimize size of toolbars, look for other styles under my name, user 12592, that  include \"Minimal\" in their style names.   Currently there is some overlap in toolbars,  since I've not learned how to reduce the size of the selection bubbles to be within the toolbars height, but it is quite usable.","user":{"id":12592,"name":"David McRitchie","email":"dmcritchie@hotmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://kb.mozillazine.org/User:Dmcritchie","about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"updated":"2008-08-04T22:32:37.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1474,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/9349_after.png?r=1679385616","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-08-04T22:32:37.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":"I removed the search bar from the navigation bar to place it to the right of the menu bar,  so that both the location bar and the search bar have more working space.
