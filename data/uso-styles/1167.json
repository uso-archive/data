{"id":1167,"name":"CustomButtons Background Color - SPECIFIC","description":"This will color an individual CustomButtons extension button to any color you wish; you will need to know what \"specific number\" it is however.  Depending on whether or not you have Dom Inspector, change the number of each button as required (they start with \"0\").  My example below is what I use; if you only have 3-4 buttons then play with changing the # at the end of each button to \"1,\" \"2,\" or \"3\" and eliminating/adding as necessary (you may only need #custombuttons-button1 {background: yellow!important} \r\nfor example)  I use it to differentiate Multi search buttons based on a great multi-image search button developed by Lou Cypher/Zoolcar9 available here:\r\nhttp://custombuttons.phpbbnow.com/viewtopic.php?t=333","user":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","paypal_email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2006-10-21T01:41:18.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":486,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/1167_after.png?r=1678348820","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-10-21T01:40:20.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*Coded by Paulfox Oct 21st, 2006 1:41AM Ver 1.0*/\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n#custombuttons-button5, #custombuttons-button6,  #custombuttons-button7 {background: yellow!important}","discussions":[{"id":4418,"name":"thanks,","rating":3,"created":"2006-10-27T02:10:20.000Z","author_name":"jw25","author_id":787},{"id":4853,"name":"Fantastic feature to have on my Firefox, thanks!!\n","rating":3,"created":"2007-01-19T16:20:33.000Z","author_name":"rumisong","author_id":1611}],"discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
