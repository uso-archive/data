Currently the url-bar is set to width of 1200px and the search-bar to 300px! If this does not match your screen, please change these prefs to fit your screen. \r\nIf the window is not maximized the url-bar and search-bar may be not full visible!\r\nI will fix it as soon as possible.","user":{"id":57112,"name":"Schippenschorsch","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-05-12T10:20:57.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":231,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/47747_after.jpeg?r=1585814512","url":"/styles/47747/fading-nav-bar","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n#main-window #nav-bar {position: fixed; background: none !important; -moz-transition: 0s ease;  opacity: 0;-moz-transition-delay: 0.5s; width:1700px !important}\r\n#urlbar {width:1200px !important}\r\n#searchbar {width:300px !important}\r\n#nav-bar:hover{opacity: 1 !important;margin-top: 27px}\r\n#nav-bar:not(:hover){-moz-transition-delay: 5s !important; margin-top: -32px}"}
