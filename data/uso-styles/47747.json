{"id":47747,"name":"Fading nav-bar","description":"Mozilla Labs have made an addon to do exactly this: https://mozillalabs.com/prospector/2011/05/20/lesschrome-hd-more-space-to-browse/\r\n\r\nThis userstyle fades in the navbar when reaching the top of the window and fades it out after 5 seconds of no mouseover on the nav-bar.\r\nThe special thing about this style is that the nav-bar is shown transparent before the content of the website (see screenshot).\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is the first release. Currently the url-bar is set to width of 1200px and the search-bar to 300px! If this does not match your screen, please change these prefs to fit your screen. \r\nIf the window is not maximized the url-bar and search-bar may be not full visible!\r\nI will fix it as soon as possible.","user":{"id":57112,"name":"Schippenschorsch","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2011-05-12T10:20:57.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":232,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/47747_after.jpeg?r=1685952012","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2011-05-11T13:49:57.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":"Update 12.05.2011: Add a delay of 0.5 seconds for fading-in.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n#main-window #nav-bar {position: fixed; background: none !important; -moz-transition: 0s ease;  opacity: 0;-moz-transition-delay: 0.5s; width:1700px !important}\r\n#urlbar {width:1200px !important}\r\n#searchbar {width:300px !important}\r\n#nav-bar:hover{opacity: 1 !important;margin-top: 27px}\r\n#nav-bar:not(:hover){-moz-transition-delay: 5s !important; margin-top: -32px}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
