  "description": "This style makes the text in workflowy bold and monospace. It also removes the horizontal scrollbar.\r\n\r\nWithin workflowy's settings, I personally use this with the \"Wood\" theme and \"Light\" font.\r\n\r\nWhy do I use \"Light\" font, not Wood's \"Typewriter\" font, which is also monospace?\r\n\r\nI like \"Typewriter\", but it isn't that visible on the iPhone, where I have no way to bold it. So I use the \"Light\" font on iPhone, but that switches the font on the web app too to \"Light\" too, which I don't want. So I created this theme because it gives you the option to have a different font selected on your iPhone or iPad than you see in your web app.",
