{"id":84844,"name":"Simple workflowy in bold monospace: light","description":"This style makes the text in workflowy bold and monospace. It also removes the horizontal scrollbar.\r\n\r\nWithin workflowy's settings, I personally use this with the \"Wood\" theme and \"Light\" font.\r\n\r\nWhy do I use \"Light\" font, not Wood's \"Typewriter\" font, which is also monospace?\r\n\r\nI like \"Typewriter\", but it isn't that visible on the iPhone, where I have no way to bold it. So I use the \"Light\" font on iPhone, but that switches the font on the web app too to \"Light\" too, which I don't want. So I created this theme because it gives you the option to have a different font selected on your iPhone or iPad than you see in your web app.","user":{"id":181597,"name":"Christoph Dollis","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://ChristophDollis.com/","about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2013-03-24T21:43:08.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":804,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/84844_after.png?r=1685520013","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/84844_additional_6879.png?r=1685520013","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/84844_additional_6880.png?r=1685520013","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/84844_additional_6887.png?r=1685520013","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/84844_additional_6888.png?r=1685520013"],"license":null,"created":"2013-03-22T11:36:38.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"workflowy","subcategory":"workflowy","additional_info":"If you do choose to use this theme, you may also want to check out my \"Monokai for Workflowy mod: dark\" theme http://userstyles.org/styles/84916/monokai-for-workflowy-mod-dark because you can install them both.
