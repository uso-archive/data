After noticing that many of the sites I use regularly didn't have any dark styles (or any styles at all for that matter), I decided to upload my own for any other sufferers (or just anyone else who likes a darker look) to use. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am in no way an expert. I am aware that most of my styles are far from perfect, but they work for what I use them for. I learned a lot of what I know from just looking at other people's styles I've used in the past; as such, everyone is welcome to make whatever changes are needed to my styles to suit their own usage/tastes (if you need help, just ask).\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has contributed to this great utility, and eternal thanks to Stylish for being exactly what lets me enjoy the web!\r\n\r\nPS. I use the FT DeepDark theme and styles for Firefox by Steva/Sr21, so my dark color scheme is similar to that (although I make mine a touch darker). If you want different colors, everything should be easily changeable.","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2016-10-15T09:56:14.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":26,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/133823_after.jpeg?r=1673596815","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2016-10-15T09:56:14.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"slurl","subcategory":"slurl","additional_info":"Because maps.secondlife.com and slurl.com use the same selectors in different ways, I had to make two styles to get everything to work properly.
