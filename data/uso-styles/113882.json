Those are the x-offsets of the 80-column and 100-column rulers, respectively. These offsets were tested on Windows 7 in Firefox, but they will undoubtedly need to be adjusted for different OSes and different browsers. That must simply be done by manually adjusting the values and guess-and-check.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eUPDATE (2015/05/18):\u003c/b\u003e I added a couple of settings. You can now choose to install the theme with white rulers (e.g., for dark themes) or black rulers (e.g., for light themes). Additionally, you can choose between Chrome and Firefox. As before, the x-offsets for the rulers have been tested on Chrome and Firefox using Windows 7 with default font sizes and 1920x1080 resolution. People with different setups will likely have to manually adjust the x-offsets.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"sharelatex.com\") {\r\n  /* change the two em-sizes to adjust the x-offset of the rulers */\r\n  /* unfortunately, css does not have a \"character width\" unit, so we have to define these by guess-and-check */\r\n  /* \"80 and 100 characters wide\" probably varies from browser-to-browser and system-to-system */\r\n  .ace_content {\r\n    background: \r\n/*[[browser]]*/\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/113882/sharelatex-com-80-100-column-code-ruler.user.js","style_settings":[{"id":445161,"style_id":113882,"install_key":"browser","label":"Browser","ordinal":0,"setting_type":"dropdown","style_setting_options":[{"id":1615083,"style_setting_id":445161,"label":"Firefox","value":"      linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(/*[[color]]*/,.3) 1px, transparent 1px) 47em/2px    repeat-y,  /* 80 columns */\r\n      linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(/*[[color]]*/,.3) 1px, transparent 1px) 58.75em/2px repeat-y;  /* 100 columns */","default":true,"ordinal":0,"install_key":"firefox"},{"id":1615084,"style_setting_id":445161,"label":"Chrome","value":"      linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(/*[[color]]*/,.3) 1px, transparent 1px) 44.35em/2px repeat-y,  /* 80 columns */\r\n      linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(/*[[color]]*/,.3) 1px, transparent 1px) 55.4em/2px  repeat-y;  /* 100 columns */","default":false,"ordinal":1,"install_key":"chrome"}]},{"id":445199,"style_id":113882,"install_key":"color","label":"Ruler color","ordinal":1,"setting_type":"dropdown","style_setting_options":[{"id":1615168,"style_setting_id":445199,"label":"White","value":"255,255,255","default":true,"ordinal":0,"install_key":"rule_white"},{"id":1615169,"style_setting_id":445199,"label":"Black","value":"0,0,0","default":false,"ordinal":1,"install_key":"rule_black"}]}]}
