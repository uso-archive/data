{"id":58170,"name":"Remove 'Playlist bar'/'Favorites bar' from Youtube","description":"I was planning on adding it to my other style: style 58169, but since the playlist/favorite bar is a useful (Non the less, annoying) tool, i decided to make a style just for it. That way you can disable this style anytime you want the playlist/favorite bar to spawn at the bottom without moving anything to the video player.\r\n\r\nThis works great along with my other style: style 58169 The only difference is that this one works on every browser, every screen resolution.","user":{"id":127255,"name":"MasterAmateur","email":"master.amateur@hotmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2011-12-19T16:35:10.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1110,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/58170_after.jpeg?r=1687593612","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2011-12-19T16:35:10.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"youtube","subcategory":"youtube","additional_info":"1.0\r\n- No big deal... it's just about hiding that annoying bar.
