Like just to look, what you've written? I don't know why 9GAG didn't implement it by themselves, because the solution is really easy. In Theory, they just need to include a simple CSS3-selector: resize. My fix needed a bit more code (forgive me for saying code, but it's the most fitting word), because of their bad implementation of their style-script.\r\nSo my fix sets the min-height of the text-area to 150px and is dynamically resizable.\r\n\r\n• Update Nov. 11th, 2017: Added a fix for the annoyance of the new sidebar / menu. Bring back the old behavior, we used to use.\r\n• Update Dec.  5th: Hide entire Youtube posts. Nobody needs Youtube videos on 9GAG.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"9gag.com\") {\r\n/* Ever tried to really do a long comment, but something really feels odd, because of the tiny text-area?
