{"id":103550,"name":"Big YouTube Videos","description":"Force YouTube videos (in Theatre mode) to use a larger theatre mode player on screens with less vertical space, such as 900px high laptops. Designed for OS X Safari, don't know if it works in other browsers. Also darken the search box and icons in the top bar so they are less distracting.","user":{"id":269499,"name":"robp","email":"rob+userstyles@pinciuc.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2018-07-27T16:50:36.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":827,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/103550_after.jpeg?r=1687507280","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/103550_additional_27845.jpeg?r=1687507280"],"license":null,"created":"2014-07-18T19:15:40.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"youtube","subcategory":"youtube","additional_info":"27 Jul 2018: Fixed.\r\n---------------\r\n16 Jul 2018: Use !important to ensure max-height is used. Change colours (darken) top bar icons so they are less distracting.\r\n---------------\r\n30 Aug 2017: Now works with YouTube's new CSS3 player update which uses calc() to set player height based on viewport height. Much simpler. Also changes colours of search box so they aren't so jarring against the new black header bar background. Progress bar and annotations all seem to be working properly and located in the correct places! \r\n---------------\r\n06 Nov 2015: Update: now doesn't break the fullscreen player!\r\n---------------\r\n?? ??? ???: Progress bar does not properly utilize the full width of the wider player. Seems to be driven by JavaScript and CSS alone cannot compensate. Annotations are not relocated properly either.\r\n---------------\r\nI update this when it breaks due to changes on YouTube's side. It probably only works with the HTML5 video player, and I only use and test it in Safari for Mac.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix('https://www.youtube.com/watch?') {\r\n\r\nytd-watch-flexy[theater] #player-theater-container.ytd-watch-flexy, ytd-watch-flexy[fullscreen] #player-theater-container.ytd-watch-flexy {\r\n  max-height: calc(100vh - 56px) !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nytd-app[is-watch-page] ytd-searchbox[mode=legacy] #container.ytd-searchbox {\r\n  border-color: #666;\r\n  box-shadow: none;\r\n  background-color: #333;\r\n}\r\n\r\nytd-app[is-watch-page] ytd-searchbox[mode=legacy] #container.ytd-searchbox input.ytd-searchbox {\r\n  color: #ccc;\r\n}\r\n\r\nytd-app[is-watch-page] #search-icon-legacy.ytd-searchbox {\r\n  background-color: #666;\r\n  border-color: #666;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.ytd-masthead button.yt-icon-button \u003e yt-icon {\r\n  color: #666;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/103550/big-youtube-videos.user.js","style_settings":[]}
