{"id":12199,"name":"IGN - Personal Usercolors","description":"Despite my lack of knowledge in CSS, I have figured out how to restore my personal usercolors without IGNBQ.  You can also use this for other users' usercolors by copying everything and changing the profile link to someone else's.\r\n\r\nBecause I assume most people on IGN are as knowledgeable as me with CSS, here's how to customize the script:\r\n\r\n1.  Put the link to your IGN boards info page in place of where my link is (href*=\"blahblahblah...)\r\n\r\n2.  Customize the text decoration.  \"color\" is the text color, \"background\" is the background color - I'm sure you can figure it out.\r\n\r\n3.  Comment out the lines you don't want (/*line of unwanted code here*/)\r\n\r\nIt may be buggy, it may break soon if the board code is updated again, whatever.  I'll fix it if I feel like it.","user":{"id":16867,"name":"gamerX1011","email":"fracture91@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-11-18T22:37:17.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":280,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/12199-after.png?r=1687420815","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-11-18T22:37:17.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"ign","subcategory":"ign","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n/*By gamerX1011, but it's probably been done before :P*/\r\n/*Changes color of your name on the IGN boards*/\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"boards.ign.com\") {\r\n\r\na.AuthorLink[href*=\"http://club.ign.com/b/about?username=gamerX1011\u0026which=boards\"] { \r\n\r\ncolor: black !important;\r\nbackground: yellow !important;\r\nborder: solid black !important;\r\nborder-width: 1px !important;\r\nfont-style: italic !important;\r\ntext-decoration: overline !important;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/12199/ign-personal-usercolors.user.js","style_settings":[]}
