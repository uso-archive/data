For now skip my other Location/Navigation bar  styles, keeping them up to date is a lost battle with no survivors.  Would love to modify this so that the url can be read by someone in back of room from a projected screen, as you can see there is certainly room for a larger font, and with a larger font the Navigation toolbar would still be bloated with both empty vertical and horizontal space.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eRecommended companion styles\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eStyle 46947 (46947)\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eStyle 114776 (114776)\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eStyle 115371 (115371)\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eStyle 9350 (9350)\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eStyle 115366 (115366), this style.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eStyle 30551 (30551)\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eStyle 54 (54), not shown but you need scrollbar.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eStyle 52 (52), not shown but you need scroolbar.\u003c/li\u003e \r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\r\n==== BOTTOM OF NOTES -- SCROLLING AREA - LIMITED VIEW =====","style_tags":[],"css":"/* Navigation Bar reduce height smaller Back button  */\r\n/* see Frank Lion - Small Location Bar Back Icon Mode... \r\n   http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=7\u0026t=2777255 */\r\n/* David McRitchie, 2015-06-18  Style #115366, updated (none)  */\r\n/*  2017-08-09 for fx55ect(20, 49px, 16px, 36px) 0 changed to 20 */\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul); \r\n/* Location Bar  reduce height with smaller back button */\r\n\r\n#back-button \u003e .toolbarbutton-icon {\r\n   border-radius: 0px !important;\r\n   -moz-image-region: rect(20, 49px, 16px, 36px) !important;\r\n   padding-top: 0px !important;\r\n   padding-left: 0px !important;\r\n   margin-left: 0px  !important;\r\n   padding-bottom: 2px !important;  }\r\n   /* 2px padding lines up vertically with Forward button */\r\n \r\n/* manages to reduce height of location bar */\r\n/* also reduces wasted horizontal space on all toolbars */\r\ntoolbarbutton {\r\n   padding: 0px !important;  } ","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
