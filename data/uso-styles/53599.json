Enter Parchment v2 Switch Message Hider, it does just what it sounds like it hides the message so you don't see it, need to see it again just turn the script off.","user":{"id":66160,"name":"pikahyper","email":null,"paypal_email":"pikahyper80@hotmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"updated":"2013-06-08T22:37:18.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":221,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/53599_after.png?r=1687248101","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"ccbyncsa","created":"2011-09-13T16:28:50.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"animevice","subcategory":"animevice","additional_info":"v1.0\r\nInitial release, a newer version probably will never need to be made since this script it so basic.\r\n\r\nv1.1\r\nAdded Animevice support.\r\n\r\nv1.1.1\r\nDropped Comicvine support since it no longer uses Parchment.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"animevice.com\") {\r\n\r\n.parchment-note{display:none!important;}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/53599/parchment-v2-switch-message-hider.user.js","style_settings":[]}
