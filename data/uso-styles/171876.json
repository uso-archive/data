  "additional_info": "<br><b>INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:</b><ol style=\"list-style:decimal\">\r\n<li><b>1.</b> After installing, open the style in the style manager to edit the style. You will see 2 code sections, each containing an option for the style.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>• OPTION #1:</b> displays only items matching your search. <a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/LrVFy4M/J7peeCv.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Animated screenshot.</b></a></li>\r\n<li><b>• OPTION #2:</b> displays all items, your search results are opaque and everything else is semi-transparent. <a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/2PLTR5w/sMUgitp.gif\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Animated screenshot.</b></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><b>2.</b> <b>Remove</b> the section containing the option that you <b>don't</b> want.</li>\r\n<li><b>3.</b> Find the following in the code: <b>/*i*/</b> and uncomment it (<b>/*i*/</b> → <b>i</b>). Due to an error with Userstyle's syntax checker, it will not let me save the style unless this is commented out. <b>If you do not have this uncommented your searches will be case-sensitive.</b></li>\r\n<li><b>4.</b> Save your changes. ....and you're done! Now you can use the style to filter your hoard and easily find the items you want to sell. <b>I recommend having live preview checked or you will have to click save every time you're done typing your search term.</b>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<b>How it works:</b>\r\nIn the site code for the area that displays the items you can list for sale, each icon also has its full name included in the code under a value called \"data-name.\" Using a <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_attribute_selectors.asp\" target=\"_blank\">CSS [attribute=\"value\"] selector</a>, you can use css to make a simple item filter. <b>You do not need to know how coding works to use this style, you just need to edit the specified area with your search term.</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Compatibility:</b>\r\n✔ Chrome, Firefox, Opera (tested with these 3 browsers, <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-case-insensitive\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a> for more browser compatibility info)\r\n✔ <a href=\"https://userstyles.org/styles/136807/flight-rising-highlight-swipp-baldwin-items-v2\">Flight Rising: Highlight Swipp &amp; Baldwin Items v2</a>\r\n\r\n<b>Other Notes:</b>\r\n\r\n1. One of the limitations of using only css is that I can't make it ignore the styling if the search has nothing in the string, so you have to disable the style when you're done searching and want to look through your items normally, and enable it again when you want to use the style to search for particular items.\r\n\r\n2. Adding any elements to the page to make this more convenient (ex. a search bar) would require this to be a userscript that uses javascript to edit the page and requires Greasemonkey to run. I'm uncomfortable making this into a script at the at the moment due to staff's stance on scripting but may in the future, though it's more likely that a search bar will be added to the site before I do make it into a script. This style is just a quick fix to make sorting through large hoards to find items you want to sell easier.\r\n\r\n3. I cannot make a search for the hoard/vault due to the lack of item names present in the codes and the fact that the hoard/vault is broken up into pages, sorry!",
