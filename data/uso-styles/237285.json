{"result":{"id":237285,"name":"Paradox Wikis | Sceptrum 2023","description":"An aesthetic, dark design for Paradox Wikis. \r\n\r\nIt's made and finetuned for Stellaris but mostly works with other titles present on the wikis as well. I consider Stellaris is complete on reader side. A few very minor glitches left, which are not worth to bother with or are out of my reach. Unnoticeable. Edit page is still a real mess, I'm going to look into it as my time allows.\r\n\r\nEU4 has its own color theme based on the game.\r\n\r\nTested on FHD and 2K. I cannot provide help with 4K.","category":"site","url":"/styles/237285/paradox-wikis-sceptrum-2023","created":"2022-04-23T18:27:15.000Z","updated":"2023-09-22T08:45:05.000Z","rating":0,"screenshotUrl":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/237285_after.png?r=1698134493","user":{"name":"Sceptrum","paypalEmail":null,"id":1951123,"photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhYhAuSQX_R5mvmjO2gp-m-JMNxmSSaD94pB7UCjQ=s96-c"},"subcategory":"paradoxwikis","isPremium":false,"weeklyInstallsCount":2,"totalInstallsCount":109,"md5":"5db86e60214667f65b582bb290703502","notes":"v1.3.5","license":"arr","obsolete":false,"exampleUrl":"https://paradoxwikis.com","afterScreenshotName":"237285_after.png","tags":[]}}
