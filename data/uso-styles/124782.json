{"id":124782,"name":"Warframe Forums: Grey/Cyan 2.1","description":"Simple rework to work with the 18.4 forum change.\r\nTo make it work, first change the official forum theme to dark theme, then enable the style.\r\nCan also work together with my old style, it's a minor change if you enable both. Tweak as you wish.\r\n\r\nI doubt I will do any more tweaking to this (other than fixing what DE breaks), it looks good enough for me. \r\nFeel free to edit as long as you give credit.","user":{"id":278761,"name":"Shifted","email":"sh.fted@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbync"},"updated":"2017-03-04T09:05:05.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":198,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/124782_after.jpeg?r=1685606419","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"ccbyncsa","created":"2016-02-26T17:14:37.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"warframe","subcategory":"warframe","additional_info":"2.1\r\nFixed broken background.\r\n\r\n2.0\r\nInitial release","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"forums.warframe.com\") {\r\nbody.ipsApp {\r\n    background: #060606 url(http://content.invisioncic.com/Mwarframe/pages_media/forums_background.jpg) no-repeat fixed center top; }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/124782/warframe-forums-grey-cyan-2-1.user.js","style_settings":[]}
