{"id":77578,"name":"reddit tf2 remove moderator stupidity.","description":"Removes the competitive header from the top of /r/tf2.\r\nRemoves the \"bonus ducks\" from usernames.\r\nRemoves all sticky posts due to moderator stupidity. TL;DR: nothing of any use has ever been said in the stickied posts.\r\n\r\nLonger version: The moderators of /r/tf2 seem to have a very narrow view of what /r/tf2 should be which means banning everything they dislike, no matter how minor, and seem to enjoy announcing rule changes as sticky posts on a daily basis. They also seem to enjoy stickying posts related to their personal interests, overriding the community choice to ignore or downvote stuff that we don't find interesting.","user":{"id":165015,"name":"goosmurf","email":"web.userstyles@mooh.org","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2015-01-28T13:01:04.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":198,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/77578-after.png?r=1683619215","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2012-10-31T18:42:05.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"reddit","subcategory":"reddit","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2\"), url-prefix(\"https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2\") {\r\ndiv.md h5 { display: none !important }\r\na.author:before {\r\n  content: \"\";\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv.linklisting div.stickied { display: none } \r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/77578/reddit-tf2-remove-moderator-stupidity.user.js","style_settings":[]}
