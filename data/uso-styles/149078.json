I highly recommend this <a href=\"https://userstyles.org/styles/147056/\">style</a> that makes the \"Show CSS Code\" button much easier to find.</b></mark> ― Crunchyroll - Depremiumize or \"Premium Removal\" will remove anything related to premium membership; such as contents nagging you to try it, or to buy it! Anything that require a premium membership will be hidden, deleted from the site. From buttons in 720P, 1080P, to log-ins, sign-ups, banners, menus, links and more. If you're already a premium member, you obliviously don't need this style. ― <b>Version:</b> 1.0.0 | <a href=\"\">View change logs</a>",

Also I'm a web stylist. I started off on a community website called Gaia Online with CSS and CSS3 style language. I continued working on websites and designs and now here I am. I am trying to make a living on making websites and web styles like theses. I do not force anyone on donating, but it is most appreciated. ♥",

Find your own! D:\r\n\r\nThis style was created because I got tired of seeing premium banners and stuff all over the place. I do not use it, I do not need it and I do not really care. I am sure it's the same thing for a lot of people. So I decided it was time to get rid of all of those things once and for all.\r\n\r\nThis style will remove;\r\n- The premium button from the navigator on top of the page.\r\n- The video quality buttons for 720P and 1080P because they require premium.\r\n- The free trial module on the right sidebar next to the video.\r\n- The premium availability in the video description.\r\n- The premium upgrade link on your profile summary.\r\n- The premium gift link under your display picture.\r\n- The premium crown next to your friends and guests display pictures.\r\n- The premium crown next to the display pictures of other users in the comments section.\r\n- The premium upgrade link from the video category.",
