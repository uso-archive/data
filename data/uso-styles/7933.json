{"id":7933,"name":"Firefox - Various Tab Tweaks","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","style_tags":[],"description":"This style is just parts of coding put together from freestyler's \"firefox 3 - tab tweaks\" and from http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/code/userchrome.txt. \r\n\r\nThis style gives the tabs a border and makes the minimum width 8px. It also makes unselected tabs transparent. However, you must change the value for browser.tabs.tabMinWidth to 0 in about:config. The default minimum width is 100px, and that will override any CSS coding that you write and use. \r\n\r\nThis works for Firefox 2, but I'm not sure about Firefox 3. I have tested it on a Windows XP operating system, and have not tried it on any other, so I am not sure If it us compatible with anything else. \r\n\r\n\r\nGlitches and Bugs:\r\n- When you have a lot of tabs open, they start to overlap. It looks bad, and is probably not supposed to happen. \r\n- Others? If you try this on your computer and you find more problems, please write a review stating the problem so that I can put it up on the description and try my best to fix it.","user":{"id":11123,"name":"jollyroger","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-06-12T05:47:53.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":486,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/7933_after.png?r=1556438487","url":"/styles/7933/firefox-various-tab-tweaks","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/* =Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤= */\r\n/*            Firefox - Tabs Less Wide       */\r\n/*                    by                     */\r\n/*              a||En.StY|isH                */\r\n/* =Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤=Â¤= */\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n\r\n/* pack all tabs as densely as we can;\r\n * also define various tab decorations\r\n * http://users.skynet.be/antoine.mechelynck/other/userChrome.css \r\n * as referenced <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=--Kdnd38gKSjCRjYnZ2dnUVZ_segnZ2d%40mozilla.org\">2006-12-17</a> by Tony Mechelynck\r\n */\r\n/* From http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/code/userchrome.txt */\r\n.tabbrowser-tabs *|tab\r\n  { margin:             0px             !important\r\n  ; border-width:       1px             !important\r\n  ; border-style:       solid           !important\r\n  ; -moz-border-radius: 2px 2px 0px 0px !important\r\n  ; border-collapse:    collapse        !important\r\n  ; padding:            0px             !important\r\n  ; text-align:         left            !important  }\r\n\r\n/* Change width of tabs*  -- Requires \r\n   browser.tabs.tabMinWidth  set to 0 in about:config */\r\n/* From http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/code/userchrome.txt */\r\n.tabbrowser-tabs *|tab {\r\n    height:    14px !important;\r\n    min-width: 8px !important; }\r\n\r\n\r\n/* ----Makes tabs transparent---- */\r\n/* Coding copied from freestyler's \"firefox 3 - tab tweaks\" */\r\n\r\ntab {opacity: 0.50 !important;}\r\n\r\ntab:hover {opacity: 0.75 !important;}\r\n\r\ntab[selected=\"true\"] {opacity: 0.90 !important;}\r\n"}
