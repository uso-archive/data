{"id":58169,"name":"Improve the look of Youtube after Cosmic Panda","description":"With the removal of Cosmic Panda, Youtube's video player was, in my opinion, pure crap. \r\nSo i came up with this User Style to tweak it a bit and make it look better. It works perfect on a 1280x720 screen resolution on Firefox, but i'm working on doing the same with other browsers and resolution.\r\n\r\nThis is useful if, for example, you're watching a video that isn't 16:9 but a wider format, because the width of the video will adjust to your screen.\r\nIt's also great if you, like me, like to zoom in the whole website.\r\n\r\nThis other stlye: style 58170 is just to remove the playlist/favorite bar from the bottom. Believe me, you don't want that with this style.","user":{"id":127255,"name":"MasterAmateur","email":"master.amateur@hotmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2011-12-19T16:34:37.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":7509,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/58169_after.jpeg?r=1687248027","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2011-12-19T16:34:37.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"youtube","subcategory":"youtube","additional_info":"1.0 \r\n- This first version (I intend on updating it as soon as Youtube changes) basically gives the video player all the space on the screen, taking in consideration the tabs (on top), bookmarks and the status bar.\r\n- The title is below the video, as it is the 'Subscribe' button and the link to the user's channel.\r\n- \"More videos from this user\" has been removed, only because changing it's position (Not only the button, but the function) would require advanced knowledge (Which i don't have).\r\n- It also removes the Feedback button.\r\n\r\n*Note* I don't have a task bar... the whole point of this is to be able to watch videos in a wider space. If you have your task bar around and you don't wanna change it, you can zoom out a bit :-)","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(youtube.com)\r\n{\r\n#watch-container {\r\nwidth: 100% !important;\r\npadding: 0px 0px 0px 0px !important;\r\nmargin-top: 10px !important;\r\n}\r\n.yt-uix-hovercard-card-border {\r\nposition: absolute !important;\r\nz-index: 20 !important;\r\n}\r\n.yt-subscription-hovercard-card-body {\r\nposition: absolute !important;\r\nz-index: 20 !important;\r\n}\r\n#yt-uix-hovercard-card3 {\r\nposition: absolute !important;\r\nz-index: 20 !important;\r\n}\r\n#watch-mfu-button {\r\ndisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n#watch-player {\r\n    height: 502px !important;\r\n    width: auto !important;\r\n    position: relative !important;\r\n    z-index: 19 !important;\r\n    margin: -0.35em -40px 0em -40px !important;\r\n}\r\n#watch-headline-title {\r\nposition: absolute !important;\r\nmargin-top: 22.95em !important;\r\ncolor: #666 !important;\r\n}\r\n#watch-headline-user-info {\r\ntext-align: right !important;\r\nmargin-top: 38.5em !important;\r\nposition: absolute !important;\r\n}\r\n#watch-stage\r\n{\r\n    background: black !important;\r\n}\r\n#watch-panel {\r\n    margin-top: 2.6em !important;\r\n}\r\n#watch-sidebar {\r\nmargin-top: 0em !important;\r\n}\r\n#masthead {\r\nmargin-bottom: -.15em !important;\r\n}\r\n#yt-feedback {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n#watch-bar-container {\r\n    background: black !important;\r\n    border: 0px !important;\r\n}\r\n#watch-video-container {\r\n    background: black !important;\r\n    padding-bottom: 3em !important;\r\n}\r\n#watch-bar .yt-uix-button-group .yt-uix-button:not([class*=\"end\"])\r\n{\r\n    border: 1px solid #444444 !important;\r\n    border-right: 0px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#watch-bar .yt-uix-button\r\n{\r\n    border: 1px solid #444444 !important; \r\n}\r\n\r\n#watch-next, #watch-prev\r\n{\r\n    border: 1px solid #444444 !important;\r\n}\r\n.yt-uix-card-body-arrow {\r\nmargin-top: 8px!important;\r\n}\r\n.yt-uix-card-body-arrow {\r\nmargin-top: 8px !important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/58169/improve-the-look-of-youtube-after-cosmic-panda.user.js","style_settings":[]}
