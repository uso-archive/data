{"id":53892,"name":"Facebook No Scroll Feed","description":"I'm a bit annoyed by the new scroll box on the right hand column of our Facebook home page. Since I have more than 1,000 friends, I noticed that it's a quite busy area, and I don't want it feeding and scrolling all the time. I prefer having a bit of control to read and scroll as I like, just using the main area of the site. So I just removed that new box completely. It's the simplest css script I have ever written in my whole life. Enjoy.","user":{"id":57584,"name":"lu_","email":"luiscarlosrubino@gmail.com","paypal_email":"luiscarlosrubino@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"updated":"2011-09-21T12:01:16.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":675,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/53892-after.png?r=1687593612","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2011-09-21T12:01:16.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"facebook","subcategory":"facebook","additional_info":"Version 0.1.\r\nCreated on Firefox on a Mac.
