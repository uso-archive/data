{"id":10386,"name":"4chan Haruhi Style","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"4chan","subcategory":"4chan","style_tags":[],"description":"Preview is here (userstyles won't let me upload it): http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l154/Quadrius/haruhiskin.jpg\r\n\r\nSo, I basically took Quiche's style and combined it with a Cave Story style I saw a while back that I liked. The Haruhi style automatically only shows on /a/, but that can be changed by changing this line:\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http://zip.4chan.org/a/) {\r\nTo any 4chan URL you wish. You can also change the \"url-prefix\" part to read \"domain\" and just toss 4chan.org in the parentheses to make it appear on all of 4chan's boards.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n1) Yes, I know the text blends with the background. I'm working on it, probably going to tone down the opacity. I'll update to the same image when I do so it automatically changes.\r\n2) I haven't changed the color of the postbox yet; I'm still screwing around with it right now.\r\n3) I am aware that the Haruhi image looks somewhat shit. I had to shrink it so it didn't look massive on a smaller monitor. I'm trying to touch it up, but it's being stupid. I'll probably replace it eventually.\r\n4) I know that when using /b/ackwash, the (OP) quote links don't look right. That's something I don't know how to fix, and seeing as how /b/ackwash pulls the image of the post, fixing it would probably require me skinning original posts. Which is probably not happening.\r\n5) The Haruhi image is anchored to the top-right, since it looks strange to lop her head off on a 1024x768 screen. Feel free to download my images and resize them as you see fit.","user":{"id":14582,"name":"Vekter","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-09-07T01:40:46.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":917,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/10386-after.png?r=1595146119","url":"/styles/10386/4chan-haruhi-style","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http://zip.4chan.org/a/) {\r\n\r\nbody[bgcolor] {\r\nbackground-image:url(http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l154/Quadrius/haruhi.png) !important;\r\nbackground-position: right top !important;\r\nbackground-repeat:no-repeat !important;\r\nbackground-attachment:fixed !important\r\n}\r\n.reply {\r\nborder: 2px solid #ff0000 ! important;\r\nbackground-image:url(http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l154/Quadrius/greyharu.png)!important;\r\nbackground-color:#87CEEB !important;\r\nbackground-position: right top !important;\r\nbackground-repeat: no-repeat !important;\r\nbackground-attachment: fixed !important;\r\n-moz-border-radius-bottomright:12px !important;\r\n-moz-border-radius-topleft:12px !important;\r\n}\r\n.replyhl {\r\nborder: 2px solid #ff0000 ! important;\r\nbackground-image:url(http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l154/Quadrius/greyharu.png)!important;\r\nbackground-color:#ADD8E6 !important;\r\nbackground-position: right top !important;\r\nbackground-repeat: no-repeat !important;\r\nbackground-attachment: fixed !important;\r\n-moz-border-radius-bottomright:12px !important;\r\n-moz-border-radius-topleft:12px !important;\r\n}\r\n.quotelink{\r\ncolor:rgb(0,128,0) !important;\r\n}\r\nDIV[class=\"4chan_ext_thread\"] > BLOCKQUOTE {\r\nmax-width:445px !important\r\n}\r\n}"}
