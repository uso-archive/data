My work and play cross paths often since I get a lot of joy out of what I do and study, some of which are:\r\n\r\n- Perl + CPAN Developer\r\n- Linux C++ Developer (Qt4, Qt5, KDE4, KFM5, and related)\r\n- Shell Script Developer (Perl, BASH, sh, upstart, vim plugin development)\r\n- Web Style Developer (CSS, SaSS, SGML, HTML5, etc) though I do know HTML4 too [who doesn't?]\r\n- Windows C++ Developer (Old Pro in Microsoft related technologies)\r\n- Old-School Technologies (qbasic, vbdos, borland c++, ms-dos 6.66, i386 assembler /w emphasis on _some_ 64-bit stuff)\r\n- Music Hobbyist (Electronic Music Writer, Piano, Keyboard player/Enthusiast)\r\n- Graphic Artist (Pencil/Pen/Watercolor physical media, Maya/Blender/3DSMax/Bryce/Gimp/Photoshop HD and post-production)\r\n\r\nI am not currently in any group at the time. I am not sure if I will be doing that ever again. The last few groups I participated in were too incoherent and seemed to have different ideals, ethics, goals. \r\n\r\nI am open to suggestion or requests, just don't make them impossible for a single person to do. Requesting a theme have a black version is probably okay. Requesting that I personally show up and restyle your entire website is probably not. Of course, if I were getting paid to do it, that would be a whole other matter, but I rarely see people paying for such things these days when you can hire someone in another country to do it for 2 cents -- that's right I'm a bitter man :D= \u003c- those are vampire teeth!!","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2015-04-27T18:14:44.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":389,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/82502_after.png?r=1687161674","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/82502_additional_14938.png?r=1687161674","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/82502_additional_14939.png?r=1687161674"],"license":"ccby","created":"2013-02-02T03:22:20.000Z","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"additional_info":"PLEASE READ THE COMMENTS IN THE CSS SOURCE!!","style_tags":[],"css":"/* AGENT_SHEET */\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/*\r\nVERY simple script to take back input boxes and make them be black on white\r\n\r\nYou may change the colors below to whatever you want them to be\r\nand it should work out fine.
