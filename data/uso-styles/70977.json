{"id":70977,"name":"Feedly Large Print Edition (works with Readly)","description":"I love Feedly, the beautiful front end for \u003cstrike\u003e\u003cdel\u003eGoogle Reader\u003c/del\u003e\u003c/strike\u003e* feed reader. However, my middle-aged eyes don't. The text size for entries and summaries is just too small, and the category labels are too low-contrast. I finally decided to do something about it.\r\n\r\nSo here's a very simple user style to make Feedly as comfortable to read for myopic infofreaks as it is stylish. It should be easy to tweak for your own needs.\r\n\r\n*Why you gotta break my heart Google man?","user":{"id":153586,"name":"lincourtl","email":"leolincourt@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2012-09-06T12:10:41.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1063,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/70977_after.jpeg?r=1677744014","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2012-08-10T10:43:54.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"feedly","subcategory":"feedly","additional_info":"\u003cb\u003e\u003cu\u003eMarch 26, 2013\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\r\nIf you're switching to Feedly from Google Reader, but miss the Google Reader layout, be sure to grab Lockal's \u003ca href=\"http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/162237\"\u003eReadly Greasemonkey script\u003c/a\u003e. It gives you a classic Google Reader layout, full width, high contrast, plus I can confirm that it works with Feedly Large Print Edition. While I still like my classic Feedly tiles and lists for most feeds, Lockal's script almost makes me want to switch to it full time.
