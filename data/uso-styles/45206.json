{"id":45206,"name":"Make icons in 'my add-ons' list the correct size","description":"For some reason (a bug?), the icons in the 'my add-ons' list are now being forcibly resized to 64x64, even though they are supposed to be 32x32 icons.  This makes them look blurry and ugly.  This style makes them 32x32 - their proper size - again.","user":{"id":350,"name":"Jez","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2011-03-14T11:30:26.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":322,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":null,"obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2011-03-14T11:30:26.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"mozilla","subcategory":"mozilla","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"addons.mozilla.org\") {\r\n    .item .icon {\r\n        width:32px !important;\r\n        height:32px !important;\r\n        padding:0px 0px 0px 25px !important;\r\n        border-radius:0px !important;\r\n    }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/45206/make-icons-in-my-add-ons-list-the-correct-size.user.js","style_settings":[]}
