(I never click these so I figured..)\r\n- \"Web\" button for search removed. \r\n- Message numbers and page numbers bar removed. There is another one on the bottom. You only need one..\r\n- a few other small things..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not a pro scripter so there are a few things I wanted to do but couldn't and well, I really just don't have time. Exams are coming up soon. \r\n\r\n - The status bar flashes like crazy with the links. It'd be nice if anyone could do a greasemonkey script and get rid of that.\r\n - The reply icons don't have transparent backgrounds. Not severe at all. But some people may find it annoying. \r\n \r\n\r\n[Edited]: Updated\r\n\r\n[April 24th, 2008]: Fixed a few things. The headers were missing and now the headers are highlighted a different color. \r\n\r\n[June 21st, 2008]: I decided to retain some of the original theme. They aren't all that bad. \r\n\r\n","user":{"id":7531,"name":"tsopeterchen","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-05-30T18:29:53.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1584,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":null,"url":"/styles/6273/live-mail-freshener-may-30th-2009-update","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"live.com\") {\r\n\r\n/* expand main list/message view width */ \r\n#MainContent{\r\nwidth: 100% !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#miniFooter > A,\r\nDIV[style=\"background-image: url(http://gfx1.hotmail.com/mail/uxp/w3/m3/pr07/h/sl.gif); background-position: right center; background-repeat: no-repeat;\"][class=\"c_hf\"],\r\n.c_ht > LI,\r\n#SkyscraperContent{\r\ndisplay:none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* More height to each row of message */\r\n.InboxTable > TBODY > TR{\r\nheight: 35px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.InboxTable > TBODY > TR:hover{\r\nbackground-color: #DDECFE !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#messageListContainer{\r\noverflow-y: scroll !important;\r\nheight: 550px !important;      \r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
