{"id":6273,"name":"Live Mail Freshener (May 30th, 2009 Update)","description":"[May 30th, 2009]:\r\n\r\nComplete Overhaul\r\n.. row highlighting\r\n.. shortened email list\r\n... expanded msg list height\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you prefer the speed of the Classic view, then here's something to push the crappy classic view up a knotch. \r\n\r\n- Ads removed\r\n- Email listing line spacing increased\r\n- Row highlighting\r\n- \"Mark as Unread\" and \"Print\" button removed from listing view. (I never click these so I figured..)\r\n- \"Web\" button for search removed. \r\n- Message numbers and page numbers bar removed. There is another one on the bottom. You only need one..\r\n- a few other small things..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not a pro scripter so there are a few things I wanted to do but couldn't and well, I really just don't have time. Exams are coming up soon. \r\n\r\n - The status bar flashes like crazy with the links. It'd be nice if anyone could do a greasemonkey script and get rid of that.\r\n - The reply icons don't have transparent backgrounds. Not severe at all. But some people may find it annoying. \r\n \r\n\r\n[Edited]: Updated\r\n\r\n[April 24th, 2008]: Fixed a few things. The headers were missing and now the headers are highlighted a different color. \r\n\r\n[June 21st, 2008]: I decided to retain some of the original theme. They aren't all that bad. \r\n\r\n","user":{"id":7531,"name":"tsopeterchen","email":"chen.tso@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-05-30T18:29:53.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1609,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":null,"obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-04-07T00:28:33.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"live","subcategory":"live","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"live.com\") {\r\n\r\n/* expand main list/message view width */ \r\n#MainContent{\r\nwidth: 100% !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#miniFooter \u003e A,\r\nDIV[style=\"background-image: url(http://gfx1.hotmail.com/mail/uxp/w3/m3/pr07/h/sl.gif); background-position: right center; background-repeat: no-repeat;\"][class=\"c_hf\"],\r\n.c_ht \u003e LI,\r\n#SkyscraperContent{\r\ndisplay:none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* More height to each row of message */\r\n.InboxTable \u003e TBODY \u003e TR{\r\nheight: 35px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.InboxTable \u003e TBODY \u003e TR:hover{\r\nbackground-color: #DDECFE !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#messageListContainer{\r\noverflow-y: scroll !important;\r\nheight: 550px !important;      \r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/6273/live-mail-freshener-may-30th-2009-update.user.js","style_settings":[]}
