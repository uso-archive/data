This is called \"Responsive design,\" also known as \"We despise the visually disabled people as they're impure and a scourge upon our world, we're going to pretend they don't exist until they're removed via eugenics.\" I feel responsive is a misnomer as in my experience it's always made sites less responsive.\r\n\r\nThis is my attempt to counter the bloody-minded ableist bigotry of the NexusMods site designer (who's probably a deeply unpleasant person) and make it easier for people who have to zoom the page to use.
