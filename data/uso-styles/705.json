{"id":705,"name":"GMail Remove Top Left Padding","description":"One of my \"final\" tweaks for GMail which gives more screen room, especially when you have many labels and \"chat\" contacts.\"  Removes the logo and the blank DIV underneath it, and also moves \"search mail\" over to left side above \"Compose Mail.\"  Works with all my other GMail scripts.\r\n\r\nAs aRIEL points out, this script might not be right for you if you like having certain status messages like \"this message has been moved to trash\" upon email deletion.  This doesn't bother me and I prefer having the room.  If you delete something to trash, you still have to go to trash and permanently delete - so I have no need for the message.  Thanks to aRIEL for pointing that out, however - it may be important to some!","user":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","paypal_email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2006-07-27T13:15:56.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1188,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/705_after.png?r=1687507214","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-07-27T13:14:44.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/* Coded by Paulfox July 27th 2006 Ver 1.1 */\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"mail.google.com\") {\r\ndiv#nt1, td[vAlign=\"top\"][width=\"149\"] { display: none !important; } }","discussions":[{"id":6999,"name":"Doesn't work with Gmail 2.","rating":1,"created":"2007-12-01T05:01:33.000Z","author_name":"Aliji","author_id":2053},{"id":7034,"name":"Great feature.
