This style will remove most features from practice mode so you can make real progress.\r\n\r\n- Removes progress bar (So you are not constantly looking at it, and becoming frustated when it goes back when you make a mistake)\r\n\r\n- Removes the excercise title (It is pretty obvious what you have to do in each exercise once you have used Duolingo for a while)\r\n\r\n- Removes the hints!!! (No more peeking into the hints, make real effort to complete the exercises and learn from your mistakes!!)\r\n\r\n- Removes Skip and Check buttons (To Check just press Enter)\r\n\r\nFor the Ultimate Focus Experience I suggest you to use Full Screen on the browser (F11 on Chrome)","user":{"id":357607,"name":"CarlosCS","email":"carloscellesmb@gmail.com","paypal_email":"carloscellesmb@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"updated":"2018-05-13T16:33:41.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":74,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/136992_after.jpeg?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2016-12-28T19:55:28.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"duolingo","subcategory":"duolingo","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"duolingo.com\") {\r\n.Mlxjr {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n._1Zqmf {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n._10knO {\r\n    background: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.XUDC1._3B1cY._1ZY-H {\r\n    color:red;\r\n    display:none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n._3GXmV._1sntG {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/136992/duolingo-master-focus-2018.user.js","style_settings":[]}
