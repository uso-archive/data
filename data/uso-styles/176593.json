Feel free to pay me to deliver other themes you may want, such as an alternative theme, extra polish, or whatever it may be; if you can, try putting the request in the payment notes, my paypal account is currently set up to accept GBP or USD if you wish to send an alternative currency let me know and I can add the currency to my account.
