{"id":92012,"name":"OkCupid - Colorblind (Hide all profile images)","description":"If you want to be like a famous talk show host and \"not see race\", this style is for you. It hides every user image on the site! Unfortunately, this also means your own page at the moment. I plan on working on a way around this, but for now you need to just disable the style while editing your profile.","user":{"id":203418,"name":"jbx0","email":"wowgandork+styles@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2013-08-18T14:27:23.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":123,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/92012_after.jpeg?r=1679040018","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"publicdomain","created":"2013-08-18T07:58:39.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"okcupid","subcategory":"okcupid","additional_info":"Notes: The screenshot has manually redacted names and descriptions, but all the images have been removed by the style automatically. The point is to show that the style has no images. It also removes (poorly) the ethnicity box on the user's profile page, to make sure you can't check.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.9 released 2013-08-18: All images removed except for the photo of you at the top of the page and the reorganization sidebar on the user's own photo page. Ethnicity (ajax_ethnicities) hidden from view.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.9.1 released 2013-08-18 (3 mins after 0.9): I forgot to hide images from messages. This has been resolved.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.9.2 released 2013-08-18 (15 mins after 0.9.1): I forgot the favorites page! And I also hid the quickmatch button. I am not going to hide images on quickmatch, that would break it. The screenshot is now out of date, pretend you don't see \"Quickmatch\" there.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.9.3 released 2013-08-18 (1 hr after 0.9.2): I was too specific. I had it only hide quickmatch on the quickmatch page. Oops. Fixed. I hope this is the last one for a while. Also, I think for 0.9.2 I also had changed the sidescrolling matches block to visiblity:hidden to retain the original \"style\" of names on bottom.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.9.4 released 2013-08-18 (8 mins after 0.9.3): I forgot to remove images from the matches page, and fortunately I got a visitor so I was able to remove the image from the toast too. Also hid images on quiver. Did some clicking around and found images on IM History page, zapped. And I think I got favorites in 0.9.3 but I forgot to mention it.\r\n\r\nVersion 0.9.5 released 2013-08-18 (5 hrs after 0.9.4): Got the image that appears on the floating profile description when you scroll down the page of a profile. Thanks to pxl8 for noticing this.\r\n\r\nGoals for 1.0: Better hide the ethnicity box (not overlap with height), figure out a way to show your own profile images. This may not be possible without a greasemonkey script, however.\r\n\r\nLicense: As shown elsewhere, I have licensed this in the public domain. I don't care what you do with it. If you improve it, I'd _appreciate_ credit, but it's not mandatory.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.okcupid.com\") {\r\ndiv#matches_block .item .image, #matches_block .item img {\r\n    visibility: hidden;\r\n}\r\n#recent_activity .user_info, #recent_activity .image img, #recent_activity .image {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\ndiv.section.recent ul li a img {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\ndiv.section.matches li.match img {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n.photobrowser .thumbnails li img {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv.tabbed_heading div#profile_thumbs div.thumb img {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n#main_column div.photo div.img img {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\ndiv#right_column ul#similar_users_list li a.user_image {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\nul#messages li a.photo img, ul#messages li a.okcupid img {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\nul#thread li .photo img {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\ndiv.user_row_item .user_image img {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\n.sidebar p, .sidebar li#nav_ratings {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\ndiv#event_display_body div.orbit_event a.thumb img {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\na.user_image {\r\n    visibility: hidden;\r\n}\r\nul#matches.new li a.photo {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\ndiv.user_row p.user_thumb {\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\ndiv#action_bar div.image img {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\ndiv#right_column div#profile_details dd#ajax_ethnicities {\r\n    line-height: 0em;\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/92012/okcupid-colorblind-hide-all-profile-images.user.js","style_settings":[]}
