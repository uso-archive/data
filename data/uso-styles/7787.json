Version 0.2 reflects the change and removes the sections again. However, the old code remains in the file for the moment in case about.com are just testing and change it back eventually. The patterns used are mutually eclusive so the old code shouldn't be able to cause problems.","user":{"id":6742,"name":"bitpicker","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"robinpfeifer@web.de","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-07-31T02:57:51.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":204,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/7787-after.png?r=1588838707","url":"/styles/7787/about-com-my-forums-chaff-remover","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/* My Forums Chaff Remover Version 0.2 */\r\n\r\n/* This script removes the My Chats, My Subscriptions and My Friends\r\n   areas from the My Forums page. */\r\n\r\n/* Version 0.2: An update to the page layout breaks version 0.1;\r\n   this version leaves the broken code in, as you never know whether\r\n   they switch back again, but the new code takes care of the change. */\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"forums.about.com\") {\r\n\r\n\r\n/* This block works where Chat rooms exist */\r\n/* Possibly broken after about.com update, July 30th 08 */\r\n\r\nscript + a + div.ptMyStuff,\r\nscript + a + div + br + a +div.ptMyStuff,\r\nscript + a + div + br + a + div + br + a + div + br + a + div.ptMyStuff \r\n{\r\ndisplay:none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* This block works where Chat rooms don't exist */\r\n/* Possibly broken after about.com update July 30th 08 */\r\n\r\nscript + br + a + div.ptMyStuff,\r\nscript + br + a + div + br + a + div + br + a + div.ptMyStuff\r\n{\r\ndisplay:none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* This block works for the layout changed around July 30th 08 */\r\n\r\n/* with chat */\r\n\r\nscript + a + div.ptMyStuff,\r\nscript + a + div + div + br + a +div.ptMyStuff,\r\nscript + a + div + div + br + a + div + br + a + div + br + a + div.ptMyStuff\r\n{\r\ndisplay:none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* without chat */\r\n\r\nscript + div + br + a + div.ptMyStuff,\r\nscript + div + br + a + div + br + a + div + br + a + div.ptMyStuff\r\n {\r\ndisplay:none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
