{"id":184568,"name":"Adjustable Width Channel Pane","description":"Allows you to resize the channel pane to maximize the chat message-area as you see fit.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no minimum or maximum width set on the column, so you can go as far in either direction as your browser allows [subject to change] - please be careful with this, and simply refresh to load defaults if you have any issues.\r\n\r\nAlso removed some horizontal padding present on the channel names themselves, and moved the voicechat participants over a bit to retain better functionality while using a very narrow channel pane.\r\n\r\nDesigned to be compatible with my other modular Discord stylesheets, and will ultimately be included in a \"compact Discord\" style once I've 'dealt with' each section of the default Discord window.","user":{"id":835132,"name":"TheTopMostDog","email":"jackaroo.dragon@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2020-06-02T01:36:33.000Z","weekly_install_count":9,"total_install_count":978,"rating":3.0,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/184568_after.jpeg?r=1687593692","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/184568_additional_36524.jpeg?r=1687593692"],"license":"publicdomain","created":"2020-06-02T01:36:33.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"discord","subcategory":"discord","additional_info":"V.1\r\nInitial release - 2 June 2020","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(discord.com)\r\n{\r\n/*resizable channel pane*/\r\n    .sidebar-2K8pFh {\r\n    resize: horizontal;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*remove channel buttons*/\r\n.children-Bmpf2Q {\r\n\tdisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*remove new channel buttons*/\r\n.children-13TY0l {\r\n\tdisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*compact channels (channel row)*/\r\n.content-3at_AU {\r\n\tmargin-left: 0px;\r\n    padding: 0 2px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*compact channels (channel icons)*/\r\n.icon-1_QxNX {\r\n\tmargin-right: 2px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*compact voice users*/\r\n.list-2bwCXU {\r\n\tpadding-left: 5px;\r\n\tpadding-bottom: 5px;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/184568/adjustable-width-channel-pane.user.js","style_settings":[]}
