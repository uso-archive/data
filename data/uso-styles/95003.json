{"id":95003,"name":"Feedly Uncropped Images","description":"Feedly crops images in both Magazine and Cards View, which is nonpractical when you're using it to follow a lot of photography blogs. This custom style changes Cards and Magazine view to display a 250px or 333px square area, where pictures are centered, uncropped and their proportions are retained.\r\n\r\nFeedback is welcomed.
