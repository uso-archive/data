If the fullsize screenshots don't fit side by side they will be shown vertically, and may then be downsized to fit window, you can view them fullsize by hovering the cursor over the image, or by using context menu \"View Image\".    You can use the arrow keys to navigate within a hovered image.   To keep mouse away from hovering on images and changing size when comparing images, suggest keeping the cursor on the vertical scrollbar.","user":{"id":12592,"name":"David McRitchie","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://kb.mozillazine.org/User:Dmcritchie","about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-11-25T20:11:10.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":964,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":null,"url":"/styles/12373/userstyles-org-downsize-screenshots-to-fit-window","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":2,"css":"/* userstyles.org - downsize screenshots to window width (DM) */\r\n/* hovering or use of context \"View Image\" will show fullsize image   */\r\n/* ===================================================== */\r\n/* David McRitchie, 2008-11-24 Style 12373, updated (none)*/\r\n/* 2008-11-25 incorporate most of downsize screenshot portion found in 11912 */\r\n\r\n/* use right arrow key to move  right when hovering over  image  */\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"userstyles.org\") {\r\n/* 14722 hover, 575  don't resize  */\r\nimg.multiple-screenshot:hover \r\n     {max-width: none !important;   }\r\nimg.single-screenshot:hover\r\n     {max-width: none !important;}\r\n\r\n/* style 321 has a resize but found better in 11912 */  \r\n/* style 11912 Large screenshots are downsized to fit the body of the page*/\r\n.screenshot-table  {display:block!important;text-align:left!important;} \r\n.screenshot-table *{display:inline-block!important}  \r\n.screenshot-table tbody,.screenshot-table tr,.screenshot-before,.screenshot-after,.screenshot  {max-width:100%!important}\r\n\r\n}  /* end brace for domain limitation */\r\n"}
