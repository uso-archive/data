(\"Best\" that is, if you like dimmed down weekdays and visually appealing accents for the weekends!)\r\n\r\nAlso, this scheme does not allow one to customize the color of weekends in the standard color-scheme, but it does allow you to (by editing the code) use the color of your choice for weekends in the accessibility scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords: Thunderbird, TB, Lightning, Calendar, views, colors, weekends, customize, etc...","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n/* This userstyle changes the color of weekends in Thunderbird's Lightning Calendar view (if addon was installed).
