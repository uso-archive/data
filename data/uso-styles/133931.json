It is particularly annoying and useless when editing emblems.\r\nI also attempted to hide the migration notice that spams reminders in the battlelog emblem editor about the BF1 companion editor.\r\n\r\nI put a lot of time into editing emblems, and it ends up getting in the way of the work space.\r\nI'm just a emblem maker and I'm a complete novice at coding, but I'm glad I've sorta figured out this code...
