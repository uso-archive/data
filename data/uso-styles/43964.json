{"id":43964,"name":"Firefox 4 Panorama native font tweak for Mac","description":"Firefox 4 introduces a new feature called Panorama that shows thumbnails of your open tabs which can be sorted and grouped. Thumbnail labels are displayed in the Tahoma font, which looks out of place in a Mac application. This tweak changes the font to Lucida Grande and slightly adjusts the text sizing, so the labels appear more native to the system.","user":{"id":59608,"name":"papermodelplane","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2011-02-10T00:30:31.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":249,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/43964_after.jpeg?r=1687593612","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2011-02-10T00:30:31.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url(\"chrome://browser/content/tabview.html\") {\r\n  body {\r\n    font-family: \"Lucida Grande\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif !important;\r\n  }\r\n  .tab-title {\r\n    font-size: 80%;\r\n    font-weight: bold;\r\n  }\r\n  .title-container {\r\n    font-size: 13px;\r\n  }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
