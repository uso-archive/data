It looks like the videos are being displayed in a 16:9 container even when they're 4:3, which means the contained video may be trapped in two sets of black bars, one for the video display and one for the rest of the screen.\r\n\r\nThis fixes these cases where 4:3 videos are trapped in two sets of bars, making them fit in the entire window.","user":{"id":298811,"name":"klingoff","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2015-09-08T04:01:43.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":879,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/118561-after.png?r=1687507214","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2015-09-08T04:01:43.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"netflix","subcategory":"netflix","additional_info":"I noticed the same problem in Amazon Video and created a fix there: style 119007","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"netflix.com\") {\r\n.player-video-wrapper video {\r\n    margin-left: -15% !important;\r\n    width: 130% !important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/118561/4-3-netflix.user.js","style_settings":[]}
