The Studio Killers logo (made up of typographic text) for text post; a design from one of the official Studio Killers t-shirts for the photo post; a screenshot from the \"All Men Are Pigs\" MV for quote post, since in the song Cherry quotes what men say to women to get them to trust them; Cherry and Jenny from the official \"Jenny\" single artwork for link post, since Cherry has a link to Jenny and feels connected to her with love; Cherry from \"Ode to the Bouncer\" for chat post, since in the song Cherry has a chat with the Bouncer, trying to get him to let her into the club; a screenshot from \"Eros and Apollo\" for audio post, just because it's a song >.>; and finally Cherry in the short video \"All About You\" for video post, because it is just a video and not a music video.","user":{"id":171935,"name":"GossamerAtara","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbync"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2013-05-18T19:21:51.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":320,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/87762_after.png?r=1588061121","url":"/styles/87762/studio-killers-tumblr-post-icons","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix('http://www.tumblr.com'), url-prefix('https://www.tumblr.com')  {\r\n\r\n.new_post_label .new_post_label_icon {\r\nbackground-image: url(http://oi41.tinypic.com/2jyc7.jpg) !important;\r\nbackground-size: 518px 95px !important;\r\nbackground-color:#fff !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
