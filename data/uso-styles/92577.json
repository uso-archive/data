{"id":92577,"name":"Google Voice Roomy Send Text Message Box","description":"Resizes the text boxes in the \"Send a text message\" modal popup to make things a little more roomy. Allows you to see all five phone numbers at once when texting several people. (I may eventually add a userscript to show contact names instead of just numbers.) Also removes rounded corners on the popup (because the background images used for rounded corners weren't wide enough).","user":{"id":209437,"name":"bengott","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"updated":"2013-11-05T10:05:03.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":222,"rating":1.0,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/92577_after.png?r=1685433610","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"ccbysa","created":"2013-09-03T10:58:26.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":"Wow. Digging into the Google Voice UI shows how truly outdated it is.
