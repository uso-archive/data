In such case you only have to redo the config. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. -----\r\n\r\nSince FF 12.0a1 version, if HCTP 2.6.0 is used with settings to disable \"Firefox 4+ Titlebar\" and \"Standard Caption (Titlebar)\", this normally causes Min-Max-Close button box misalignment (see main screenshot). Here you can find more info https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-caption-titlebar-plus-sma/versions/#version-2.6.0\r\n\r\nHCTP 2.6.# reserves some space for Min-Max-Close button box with 'System buttons' style (which it normally forces) in the upper bar, the size of Aero style buttons box (or some other theme with wide buttons box). But if other way you use a narrow button box, you can use this code to try to adjust it not to waste space in the upper bar (as you can see in the main screenshot). Options are added to do this for the case each one of Menu Bar (in the main screenshot), Navigation Bar, Tab Bar or Bookmarks Bar is used as the upper bar. \u003cu\u003e\u003cb\u003eYou have to manually activate the code matching the upper bar you use (only for one bar)\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/b\u003e, check the code, its clearly indicated, you only have to add a / character after the standalone * character at the end of the comment that matches the code for your upper bar (closing it) */ Follow code comments instructions.\r\n\r\nHCTP 2.6.# and 2.7.# versions apply solutions for the new FF UI since FF 12.0a1 to mitigate that emerging problems, which made Min-Max-Close button box not to reside in the upper window bar. That means the fullscreen upper bars autohiding feature will not apply for Min-Max-Close buttons. This userstyle provides, independent from the upper bars, Min-Max-Close buttons autohiding styles (that depending on the buttons style used with HCTP, will be an extra one or not, in addition to the one provided by 'Micro close-button' setting). Buttons are not completely hidden on purpose with the provided set, to mark where to hover mouse for showing them, but you can hide them (or almost, depending on the buttons style showed), while keeping them working, follow instructions on the code. To unhide buttons box you have to hover on its specific area, but that will only show these buttons and not the Firefox upper bars; unless you hover on top of the fullscreen window but out of the Min-Max-Close button box area, and without releasing the top bars you hover on the button box area. I've attached some captures to show it.\r\n\r\nI tested this userstyle against HCTP 2.6.0-FF 12.0 and HCTP 2.7.3-FF 23.0a1 with 32-bit FF in Windows. The values are adjusted to windows system buttons styles and my settings, which includes smaller tabs\u0026tabbar and toolbar\u0026buttons from the advanced HCTP options, but these settings probably will fit yours easily; try playing with the values in the code if you need finer tuning.\r\nLet me know if you have code to improve this solution, and I'll add it, or use this code to make your own freely... and ask me if you need any help.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n/* NOTES: DEPENDING ON HCTP-FF VERSIONS COMBINATION, MIN-MAX-CLOSE BUTTONS IS SHOWED IN EITHER SYSTEM BUTTONS STYLE\r\n(NORMALLY WITH HCTP 2.7.# WITH 'System buttons' NOT DISABLED OR WITH HCTP 2.6.#) OR IN HCTP BUTTONS STYLE (NORMALLY\r\nWITH HCTP 2.7.# WITH 'System buttons' DISABLED). http://cdn.userstyles.org/style_screenshots/66071_additional_7022.png\r\nWITH FF 18.0a1 AND HCTP 2.6.0 SET, I'VE EXPERIENCED MIN-MAX-CLOSE BUTTONS IN MAXIMIZED WINDOWS BUTTONS CHANGING STYLE\r\nRANDOMLY AND INADVERTENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME.
