After noticing that many of the sites I use regularly didn't have any dark styles (or any styles at all for that matter), I decided to upload my own for any other sufferers (or just anyone else who likes a darker look) to use. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am in no way an expert. I am aware that most of my styles are far from perfect, but they work for what I use them for. I learned a lot of what I know from just looking at other people's styles I've used in the past; as such, everyone is welcome to make whatever changes are needed to my styles to suit their own usage/tastes (if you need help, just ask).\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has contributed to this great utility, and eternal thanks to Stylish for being exactly what lets me enjoy the web!\r\n\r\nPS. I use the FT DeepDark theme and styles for Firefox by Steva/Sr21, so my dark color scheme is similar to that (although I make mine a touch darker). If you want different colors, everything should be easily changeable.","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-08-09T18:40:15.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":217,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/117232-after.png?r=1591171582","url":"/styles/117232/netizenbuzz-dark-nova","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"netizenbuzz.blogspot.com\") {\r\n\r\nhtml, body\r\n{color: white !important;\r\nbackground: #111 !important;}\r\n  \r\na\r\n{color: #00adee !important;\r\ntext-decoration: none !important;}\r\n  \r\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, .meta_date\r\n{color: white !important;}  \r\n  \r\n.social-profiles-widget, .post-share-buttons, #footer\r\n{display: none !important;} \r\n  \r\n#search, .fp-nav\r\n{color: white !important;\r\nbackground: #222 !important;}    \r\n\r\n#header-wrapper, .menu-secondary-container, #content-wrapper\r\n{color: white !important;\r\nbackground: #222 !important;\r\nborder: 0 !important;}\r\n  \r\n#comments\r\n{background: #222 !important;\r\nborder: 1px solid #00adee !important;} \r\n  \r\n.readmore a, .home-link, #blog-pager-newer-link, #blog-pager-older-link \r\n{color: white !important;\r\nbackground: #222 !important;\r\nborder: 1px solid #00adee !important;\r\ntext-decoration: none !important;\r\npadding: 4px 4px 4px 4px;}   \r\n\r\n.menu-secondary li a, #main-wrapper\r\n{text-shadow: none !important;}\r\n  \r\n#content-wrapper\r\n{padding: 10px 15px 0px 15px;\r\nmargin-bottom: 15px !important;}  \r\n  \r\n}"}
