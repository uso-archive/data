{"id":265193,"name":"ChatGPT Wider Text for half-screen on 4k","description":"When working with code and snapping a browser to one side, and IDE to the other, often the max-width of the responses leaves too much empty space IMO, so to better utilize screen space, and in turn have to scroll less, we simply override the offending media queries and allow the elements to fill a larger space. I got annoyed over the excess unused space (the gutters) surrounding responses when working in split screen or snapped views on a large desktop screen.","user":{"id":3652115,"name":"Sean Johnson","email":"invalid1021@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2023-05-31T10:52:55.000Z","weekly_install_count":29,"total_install_count":86,"rating":5.0,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/265193_after.gif?r=1687593692","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2023-05-31T10:50:09.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"openai","subcategory":"openai","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain('chat.openai.com'){\r\n.lg\\:max-w-xl {max-width: /*[[user_width]]*/ ;}\r\n.lg\\:max-w-2xl {max-width:/*[[user_width]]*/ ;}\r\n\r\n.xl\\:max-w-3xl {max-width: /*[[user_width]]*/ ;}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/265193/chatgpt-wider-text-for-half-screen-on-4k.user.js","style_settings":[{"id":472280,"style_id":265193,"install_key":"user_width","label":"Content Width","ordinal":0,"setting_type":"text","style_setting_options":[{"id":1669663,"style_setting_id":472280,"label":"placeholder","value":"85%","default":true,"ordinal":0,"install_key":"placeholder"}]}]}
