{"id":17628,"name":"Update Notifier: Less Visible when No Updates","description":"This style makes Update Notifier a little less noticeable when it has nothing to tell you. I have removed the dropdown marker and adjusted the margins as well. This is mainly intended for those who have it placed next to their throbber, like in my screenshot.\r\n\r\nUpdates:\r\n\r\nJul 26 2009 - Fixed an issue with the way FF 3.5 handles opacity. Not sure if this works on 3 now, if not just add \"moz-\" before opacity and it should work.","user":{"id":22577,"name":"TtWEAK","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-07-26T09:23:48.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":160,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/17628_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-05-05T22:38:59.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n/* REMOVE DROPDOWN MARKER */\r\n#un-toolbarbutton \u003e dropmarker {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* ADJUST MARGINS */\r\n.un-icons {\r\n  margin: -1px 0px 0px 0px !important;\r\n  padding: 0px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* HALF-OPACITY WHEN NO UPDATES */\r\n.un-icons[icon=\"none\"] {\r\n opacity: 0.5 !important;\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
