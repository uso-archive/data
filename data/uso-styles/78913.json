I re-used the regexp string from it for a lazy fix people can enable at will to not have these changes applied to the Google Search and Google Images front pages. May require end-user tweaking.\r\n\r\nYou may want to install \u003ca href=\"http://userstyles.org/styles/78276\"\u003ethis\u003c/a\u003e first if you are looking for the code to add a background image to Google (image) search's front page.\r\n\r\nThis style was created to give users the capability to make the Google interface more darker, and indirectly to allow use of dark backgrounds in Google Web and Google Images by making the name of the present Google+ user white.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e05/21/2014\u003c/i\u003e Okay, so I fixed it well enough for now, but it will be update later on today. Also deleted old update history because it was starting to look sad and none of it was dated.\r\n\r\nI also added share highlight text preferences, just because I was sick of pushing another class-changing update. Google logo remains untouched because of a doodle presently in use; When Google changes it back, it will be using a different class.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e06/23/2014\u003c/i\u003e Corrected update log... I think. Due to familial issues, I cannot work on CSS like I use to. Don't fret about me quitting; I have not. I will continue to work on my styles and fight for user rights to see the web how they want to see it through continued updating against the well-funded war machine that is the Googleplex.\r\n\r\nAlso, I lied in the last update log, sorry about that.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e06/23/2014\u003c/i\u003e Class changes\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e06/27/2014\u003c/i\u003e Class changes, image positioning changes\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e06/29/2014\u003c/i\u003e Class changes, slight cleanup.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e07/02/2014\u003c/i\u003e Class change.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e07/04/2014\u003c/i\u003e Class change.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e07/08/2014\u003c/i\u003e Class changes.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e07/12/2014\u003c/i\u003e Class change.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e07/21/2014\u003c/i\u003e Class changes and value changes to account for a new image used in Google's webpage.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e07/30/2014\u003c/i\u003e Class changes, and some code-neatening. If something looks messed up, send a private message.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e08/26/2014\u003c/i\u003e Okay, this requires a little explanation. There has not been a tectonic plate shift in the Google verse, so I could knock this out in a matter of minutes. Why the long wait then? I was involved in other projects outside of here. Shame on me. Anyway, here's the update! Just some class changes, and the removal of some classes that didn't \u003ci\u003elook\u003c/i\u003e necessary anymore.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e09/11/2014\u003c/i\u003e Class changes, background position changes for icons. Never forget.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e09/22/2014\u003c/i\u003e Class changes.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e09/26/2014\u003c/i\u003e The straw that broke the camel's back was Google using different images for the same interface buttons. I had enough, so I uploaded a copyof one of their interface images to imgur and with the help of frecyber from the userstyles.org forums, I figured out how to make the image I wanted to use work.\r\n\r\nAlso, class change for font color.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e10/14/2014\u003c/i\u003e Projects, projects, projects. Lots of things I am doing is detracting from my time of doing CSS stuff, but here's the new official update.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e10/27/2014\u003c/i\u003e More distractions in my life, nd also more things Google is doing in its code. Fortunately with the exclusion of the \"Share\" text this style has become a bit easier to manage, but only marginally.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e11/15/2014\u003c/i\u003e Class changes.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e12/07/2014\u003c/i\u003e Class changes.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e12/16/2014\u003c/i\u003e Google decided to quit making small changes and instead make my life a little bit more miserable. Nonetheless I found a way around their changes.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e01/16/2015\u003c/i\u003e Class changes.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e02/10/2015\u003c/i\u003e Class changes.
