  "additional_info": "This update comes after I figured out what I had to do to accommodate what some people might want when using the style linked below. I re-used the regexp string from it for a lazy fix people can enable at will to not have these changes applied to the Google Search and Google Images front pages. May require end-user tweaking.\r\n\r\nYou may want to install <a href=\"http://userstyles.org/styles/78276\">this</a> first if you are looking for the code to add a background image to Google (image) search's front page.\r\n\r\nThis style was created to give users the capability to make the Google interface more darker, and indirectly to allow use of dark backgrounds in Google Web and Google Images by making the name of the present Google+ user white.\r\n\r\n<i>05/21/2014</i> Okay, so I fixed it well enough for now, but it will be update later on today. Also deleted old update history because it was starting to look sad and none of it was dated.\r\n\r\nI also added share highlight text preferences, just because I was sick of pushing another class-changing update. Google logo remains untouched because of a doodle presently in use; When Google changes it back, it will be using a different class.\r\n\r\n<i>06/23/2014</i> Corrected update log... I think. Due to familial issues, I cannot work on CSS like I use to. Don't fret about me quitting; I have not. I will continue to work on my styles and fight for user rights to see the web how they want to see it through continued updating against the well-funded war machine that is the Googleplex.\r\n\r\nAlso, I lied in the last update log, sorry about that.\r\n\r\n<i>06/23/2014</i> Class changes\r\n\r\n<i>06/27/2014</i> Class changes, image positioning changes\r\n\r\n<i>06/29/2014</i> Class changes, slight cleanup.\r\n\r\n<i>07/02/2014</i> Class change.\r\n\r\n<i>07/04/2014</i> Class change.\r\n\r\n<i>07/08/2014</i> Class changes.\r\n\r\n<i>07/12/2014</i> Class change.\r\n\r\n<i>07/21/2014</i> Class changes and value changes to account for a new image used in Google's webpage.\r\n\r\n<i>07/30/2014</i> Class changes, and some code-neatening. If something looks messed up, send a private message.\r\n\r\n<i>08/26/2014</i> Okay, this requires a little explanation. There has not been a tectonic plate shift in the Google verse, so I could knock this out in a matter of minutes. Why the long wait then? I was involved in other projects outside of here. Shame on me. Anyway, here's the update! Just some class changes, and the removal of some classes that didn't <i>look</i> necessary anymore.\r\n\r\n<i>09/11/2014</i> Class changes, background position changes for icons. Never forget.\r\n\r\n<i>09/22/2014</i> Class changes.\r\n\r\n<i>09/26/2014</i> The straw that broke the camel's back was Google using different images for the same interface buttons. I had enough, so I uploaded a copyof one of their interface images to imgur and with the help of frecyber from the userstyles.org forums, I figured out how to make the image I wanted to use work.\r\n\r\nAlso, class change for font color.\r\n\r\n<i>10/14/2014</i> Projects, projects, projects. Lots of things I am doing is detracting from my time of doing CSS stuff, but here's the new official update.\r\n\r\n<i>10/27/2014</i> More distractions in my life, nd also more things Google is doing in its code. Fortunately with the exclusion of the \"Share\" text this style has become a bit easier to manage, but only marginally.\r\n\r\n<i>11/15/2014</i> Class changes.\r\n\r\n<i>12/07/2014</i> Class changes.\r\n\r\n<i>12/16/2014</i> Google decided to quit making small changes and instead make my life a little bit more miserable. Nonetheless I found a way around their changes.\r\n\r\n<i>01/16/2015</i> Class changes.\r\n\r\n<i>02/10/2015</i> Class changes. Sorry it took so long, I don't visit Google every day!",
