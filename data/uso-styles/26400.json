{"id":26400,"name":"DJDownload Redness Reduction","description":"DJDownload is my favourite online music store (mainly because of the awesome Needledrop Player) but the red backgrounds throughout the site cause me severe eye-strain - it's not great for mood either!. \r\n\r\nThis stylesheet changes as much as possible of the track listing and info pages to have black or dark backgrounds. Text colour is also altered so that it provides good contrast without being glaringly bright.\r\n\r\nThe effect is to make DJD much easier on the eye for me. \r\nIf you don't like my choice of colours, download it anyway and substitute your own! Instructions are in the CSS.\r\n\r\nThis stylesheet doesn't aim to be totally comprehensive - I'm not bothered about odd pages that aren't included, such as the Multi Download manager, and I make no attempt to precisely reproduce DJD's look in black (eg rounded corners) - the only aim is to reduce the red overload during normal track browsing activities. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, suggestions and improvements are welcome.
