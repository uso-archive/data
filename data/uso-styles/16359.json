So far, I made a small update to fix more of that.\r\n*UPDATE 2:  I noticed that some wowhead links in certain posts were not working, so I went ahead and fixed that.","user":{"id":21510,"name":"Mikeyrocks","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-05-04T23:16:57.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":312,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/16359-after.png?r=1588752331","url":"/styles/16359/mmo-champion-remove-ads","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"mmo-champion.com\") {\r\n    #pub, .pub, #block29, #block20, #block31, .vert-adsBlock {display: none !important;}\r\n\r\n    A[HREF*=\"ptr.\"],\r\n    A[HREF*=\"wowhead.com\"] {display: inline !important;}\r\n\r\n    *[SRC*=\"a.\"],\r\n    *[SRC*=\"ad.\"],\r\n    *[SRC*=\"rmd.\"],\r\n    *[SRC*=\"ad.doubleclick.net\"] {display: none !important;}\r\n\r\n    *[HREF*=\"a.\"],\r\n    *[HREF*=\"ad.\"],\r\n    *[HREF*=\"rmd.\"],\r\n    *[HREF*=\"ad.doubleclick.net\"] {display: none !important;}\r\n}"}
