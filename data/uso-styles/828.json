This is probably not a very useful style, but there's a few people who may appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI also use adblock+, so keep that in mind if you still see ads.","user":{"id":635,"name":"SKYY","email":"skyyspam@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2006-08-18T23:12:43.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1052,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/828-after.png?r=1686556816","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-08-18T23:12:43.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"newegg","subcategory":"newegg","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/* SKYY's newegg cleaner */\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(newegg.com)\r\n{\r\n\r\n[id=\"bottomAd1\"],[id=\"bannerAd1\"],[id=\"awards\"],[id=\"rightArea\"],[id=\"promotion\"]\r\n{\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/828/website-cleaner-newegg-com.user.js","style_settings":[]}
