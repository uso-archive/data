{"id":126820,"name":"Scribd Reveal","description":"When using scribd without signing in to a paid account, parts of many documents are blurred or dimmed. This userstyle 1) uncovers and unblurs these sections, 2) makes text selectable, and 3) removes boxes throughout the document explaining the blurred section and the bar above the document prompting login.\r\n\r\nIf there's any documents that are still blurred or dimmed leave a question/review (please provide a URL!) and I'll try to fix it.\r\n\r\n\u003cstrong\u003eNOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e Depending on your OS and text-rendering, this userstyle may make text (even in non-blurred sections) considerably more jagged or pixely. You can disable this userstyle from the stylish menu to return text to normal, as always.","user":{"id":271292,"name":"jTron","email":"jordanyb@me.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"updated":"2016-12-18T21:17:59.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":541,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":null,"obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2016-04-17T01:52:01.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"scribd","subcategory":"scribd","additional_info":"Update 2016-12-18:\r\n- Should work on some newer scribd pages that blur documents differently.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/\"), url-prefix(\"https://www.scribd.com/document/\") {\r\n.autogen_class_views_pdfs_page_blur_promo {\r\n  display: none!important;\r\n}\r\ndiv.text_layer {\r\n  text-shadow: black 0 0 0!important;\r\n  -webkit-user-select: text;\r\n  -moz-user-select: text;\r\n  -ms-user-select: text;\r\n  user-select: text;\r\n}\r\n.page_missing_explanation {\r\n  display: none!important;\r\n}\r\n.trial_upsell {\r\n  display: none!important;\r\n}\r\n.autogen_class_views_pdfs_show.has_toolbar_nag .document_column .document_scroller {\r\n  top: 50px;\r\n}\r\ndiv.image_layer .absimg {\r\n  opacity: 1!important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":50330,"name":"Scribd Deblur","rating":3,"created":"2016-06-25T22:44:11.000Z","author_name":"NeonHD","author_id":294559}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/126820/scribd-reveal.user.js","style_settings":[]}
