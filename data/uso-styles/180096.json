{"id":180096,"name":"Fish's Tumblr Dash Tweaks","description":"I made this thing years ago after tumblr removed blockquotes, and never really thought to post it. But a friend wanted it, so I figured I should make it available to everyone.\r\n\r\nQuick summary of what this does:\r\n- Indicates new additions to posts and grays out inactive blogs.\r\n- Rearranges posts to be more condensed.\r\n- Hides ads and suggestions\r\n\r\nI personally use this alongside a pretty basic XKit setup, but it seems to work the same with or without XKit.","user":{"id":437163,"name":"BabblingFishes","email":"42andallthatjazz@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"https://babblingfishes.tumblr.com","about":"[UPDATE: Due to Stylish's frequent server issues, I am in the process of moving my userstyles to GreasyFork. I will not be returning to Stylish until the site issues are fixed.]\r\n\r\nI'm a web developer with some visual/attention issues, so I end up coding little styles to get rid of things that make my life harder. Some of them have the side effect of being fun and aesthetically pleasing, too.\r\n\r\nI try to make my code easy to read for both people and machines, so you can edit my styles to suit your needs. If you need help with something, or if one of my styles broke, you can ask me about it on my tumblr.\r\n\r\nAlso note: I don't frequent this site; I only post things here as a place to keep them, so I'll probably end up adding things that have been done before. Sorry about that.","license":"ccby"},"updated":"2020-08-04T18:47:24.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":134,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/180096_after.png?r=1687161674","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2020-02-12T09:54:40.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"tumblr","subcategory":"tumblr","additional_info":"\u003cb\u003eWhat it does:\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\r\nAround your dash:\r\n- Hides recommended posts, recommended blogs, tumblr radar, and ad boxes.\r\n\r\nInside posts:\r\n- Pushes authors' usernames to the right side and removes their avatar icons so that peoples' bad username/icon choices don't mess up your funky flow.\r\n- Deactivated blogs' usernames are greyed out instead of having the dumb effect where the \"deactivated\" text pops up when you hover over it. No more surprises.\r\n- If the person reblogging made a new addition, there is a pale blue bar in the margin beside their addition, so you know it's new.\r\n- Shrinks margins, meaning less empty space, making those 50-reply posts a little easier to scroll past.\r\n- The aforementioned margin thing has the weird side effect of making images a little bigger sometimes, which I actually think is pretty neat.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eFAQ:\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\r\nQ: Does this block ads?\r\nA: Nope, just hides the boxes containing them. If you want to fully block ads, I strongly suggest using uBlock Origin.\r\n\r\nQ: I want some features but not others!\r\nA: I'm not going to make toggles for everything, but I have left nice little comments above each bit of code. If you really hate something, try deleting the lines of code underneath the appropriate comment.\r\n\r\nQ: This broke something that shouldn't be broken!\r\nA: Send me a screenshot on tumblr! I'm babblingfishes there too.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I edit/repost this code for my own project?\r\nA: Yup! As long as you credit me.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eChangelog:\u003c/b\u003e\r\n2020-08-04:\r\nRemoved a new type of oversized video ad.\r\n2020-04-23:\r\nFixed an issue where the sidebar menu was hidden when managing your own posts.\r\n2020-03-30:\r\nTumblr's updated its theme!
