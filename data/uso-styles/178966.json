  "description": "We all love MyAnimeList, but there's two things it lacks. The first being dark mode, there's a ton of scripts already. But the second is a sticky header. And that's where this script comes in. Nothing fancy, but it does the job. Especially created for people with a small screen who have to take screenshots for Official AWC with both stats far down the page, and their username hidden up top.",

This has been fixed!\r\n\r\n05/04/2020:\r\n+ You know those people with exceptional long profiles? Ever experienced that you wanted to comment on someone's profile page, but forgot whose profile you were visiting? Fear no more! The header containing the username is now also stickied!\r\n+ Also added the the sticky header for clubs.\r\n\r\n10/01/2020:\r\n+ Removed a bit of redundant CSS\r\n+ Added comments to what part of the CSS stickies what part of MAL. If you only want the MAL logo & Username part stickied, you can comment out the rest.",
