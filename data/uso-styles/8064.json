{"id":8064,"name":"about.com Disable Signature Chop-Off","description":"Version 0.1\r\n\r\nThis script removes the about.com-imposed vertical size restriction of 500 pixels for signatures.\r\n\r\nBut if large signatures bug you, you can easily use the script to impose an even more restrictive policy: just change the value 'max-height:none' to 'max-height:250px' to restrict the displayed signature size to 250 pixels. You can use any value you like, and a value of 0 pixels would display no signature - though there is an in-built forum function for that and another script of mine, too.","user":{"id":6742,"name":"bitpicker","email":"bitpicker@compuserve.de","paypal_email":"robinpfeifer@web.de","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-06-18T02:10:07.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":182,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/8064-after.png?r=1684569613","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-06-18T02:10:07.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"about","subcategory":"about","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/* about.com Disable Signature Chop-Off 0.1 */\r\n\r\n/* This short script disables the signature size restriction\r\n   of 500 pixels vertical. */\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"forums.about.com\") {\r\n\r\ntd.pfMsgBody div.pfMsgSig\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tmax-height:none !important;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/8064/about-com-disable-signature-chop-off.user.js","style_settings":[]}
