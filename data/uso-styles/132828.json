After noticing that many of the sites I use regularly didn't have any dark styles (or any styles at all for that matter), I decided to upload my own for any other sufferers (or just anyone else who likes a darker look) to use. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am in no way an expert. I am aware that most of my styles are far from perfect, but they work for what I use them for. I learned a lot of what I know from just looking at other people's styles I've used in the past; as such, everyone is welcome to make whatever changes are needed to my styles to suit their own usage/tastes (if you need help, just ask).\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has contributed to this great utility, and eternal thanks to Stylish for being exactly what lets me enjoy the web!\r\n\r\nPS. I use the FT DeepDark theme and styles for Firefox by Steva/Sr21, so my dark color scheme is similar to that (although I make mine a touch darker). If you want different colors, everything should be easily changeable.","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2017-01-27T23:00:05.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":51,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/132828_after.jpeg?r=1573113671","url":"/styles/132828/scoop-it-dark-wider-nova","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.scoop.it\") {\r\n\r\nhtml, body, #headbanner, #theme-actions-banner, #themeBanner .theme-header, #themeDescription, .block-content, .navtab-menu\r\n{color: #919191 !important;\r\nbackground: #111 !important;}\r\n  \r\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, blockquote, .post-description, #themeAuthor, .post-metas\r\n{color: #919191 !important;}    \r\n  \r\na\r\n{color: #00adee !important;}\r\n\r\na:visited \r\n{color: #00668c !important;} \r\n  \r\n.footer, .inline-scoopit-window, #customHTML, .post-bottom-colored, .uv-icon.uv-bottom-right, #theme-toolbox, #headbanner, #theme-actions-banner, .vote-badge.vote-badge-header-center, .rescoop-container, .post .post-from\r\n{display: none !important;}\r\n  \r\n.post\r\n{color: #919191 !important;\r\nbackground-color: #181818 !important;\r\nheight: 600px !important;\r\noverflow: scroll !important;\r\npadding: 5px !important;}\r\n  \r\n.thisistherealimage\r\n{height: auto !important;}\r\n  \r\n.theme-post-list\r\n{padding-bottom: 0px !important;}\r\n  \r\n.theme-post-list\r\n{width: 100% !important;\r\npadding-left: 100px !important;  \r\npadding-bottom: 20px !important;} \r\n  \r\ntd\r\n{display: flex !important;\r\nflex-flow: row wrap !important; \r\nwidth: 100% !important;}\r\n\r\n#utilArea \r\n{padding-bottom: 20px !important;}  \r\n  \r\n.pagination ul li a \r\n{border: 1px solid #00adee !important;}  \r\n\r\n.pagination ul li.current a \r\n{background-color: #00668c !important;}  \r\n  \r\n}"}
