Please note this style is still a work in progress!","user":{"id":46647,"name":"Novadestin","email":"novadestin@yahoo.com","paypal_email":"novadestin@gmail.com","homepage":"http://www.wiccananime.com","about":"Hello everyone! \r\n\r\nI suffer from photophobia and use Stylish to alleviate some of my eye strain due to the horrid black on white \"standard\" of the web. After noticing that many of the sites I use regularly didn't have any dark styles (or any styles at all for that matter), I decided to upload my own for any other sufferers (or just anyone else who likes a darker look) to use. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am in no way an expert. I am aware that most of my styles are far from perfect, but they work for what I use them for. I learned a lot of what I know from just looking at other people's styles I've used in the past; as such, everyone is welcome to make whatever changes are needed to my styles to suit their own usage/tastes (if you need help, just ask).\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has contributed to this great utility, and eternal thanks to Stylish for being exactly what lets me enjoy the web!\r\n\r\nPS. I use the FT DeepDark theme and styles for Firefox by Steva/Sr21, so my dark color scheme is similar to that (although I make mine a touch darker). If you want different colors, everything should be easily changeable.","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2017-01-27T23:00:05.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":58,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/132828_after.jpeg?r=1676361614","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2016-09-18T17:57:46.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"scoop","subcategory":"scoop","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.scoop.it\") {\r\n\r\nhtml, body, #headbanner, #theme-actions-banner, #themeBanner .theme-header, #themeDescription, .block-content, .navtab-menu\r\n{color: #919191 !important;\r\nbackground: #111 !important;}\r\n  \r\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, blockquote, .post-description, #themeAuthor, .post-metas\r\n{color: #919191 !important;}    \r\n  \r\na\r\n{color: #00adee !important;}\r\n\r\na:visited \r\n{color: #00668c !important;} \r\n  \r\n.footer, .inline-scoopit-window, #customHTML, .post-bottom-colored, .uv-icon.uv-bottom-right, #theme-toolbox, #headbanner, #theme-actions-banner, .vote-badge.vote-badge-header-center, .rescoop-container, .post .post-from\r\n{display: none !important;}\r\n  \r\n.post\r\n{color: #919191 !important;\r\nbackground-color: #181818 !important;\r\nheight: 600px !important;\r\noverflow: scroll !important;\r\npadding: 5px !important;}\r\n  \r\n.thisistherealimage\r\n{height: auto !important;}\r\n  \r\n.theme-post-list\r\n{padding-bottom: 0px !important;}\r\n  \r\n.theme-post-list\r\n{width: 100% !important;\r\npadding-left: 100px !important;  \r\npadding-bottom: 20px !important;} \r\n  \r\ntd\r\n{display: flex !important;\r\nflex-flow: row wrap !important; \r\nwidth: 100% !important;}\r\n\r\n#utilArea \r\n{padding-bottom: 20px !important;}  \r\n  \r\n.pagination ul li a \r\n{border: 1px solid #00adee !important;}  \r\n\r\n.pagination ul li.current a \r\n{background-color: #00668c !important;}  \r\n  \r\n}","discussions":[{"id":51580,"name":"Flexbox help for widescreen style","rating":0,"created":"2016-09-18T18:05:00.000Z","author_name":"Novadestin","author_id":46647}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/132828/scoop-it-dark-wider-nova.user.js","style_settings":[]}
