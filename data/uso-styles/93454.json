All, or if not, most extensions are compatible with this style. Mind the color of the stripes in the bar:\r\n\r\nGreen: Secure website with extended validation (like addons.mozilla.org)\r\nBlue: Secure website with standard validation (like https://www.google.com)\r\nOrange: Secure websites with non-secured content, or rather, websites with mixed content.\r\n\r\nMixed content uses a more cautionary color, because mixed content websites -- Those with insecure HTTP content in an HTTPS space can become compromised by malicious hackers and risk revealing your identity and sensitive details to whoever is maliciously utilizing this information. Since not everyone will know at-a-glance the mixed content icon, or care to see it, blasting this information in your face with a splash of color is a sure-fire way to know if you're in a space where your personal information can become compromised.\r\n\r\nThe images in the style are encoded in Base64. Don't fret, you can remove them rather easily.\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003eIf the pattern is too busy, or if the pattern feels unwarranted, let me know in a discussion and I'll gladly modify it to solid colors.
