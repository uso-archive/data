  "additional_info": "This is something I whipped up for myself. Like many people, I use Facebook not for keeping in touch and having conversations, but as a news feed. It's a nice little distraction. \r\n\r\nBut let's face it, most of the comments are totally worthless, and often aggravating, so much so, that you feel compelled to write your own. And you know, nobody cares what you have to say. Not really. But you read it, you get sucked in, maybe add your own 2 cents, and you never get that time back.\r\n\r\nSo here's my solution. Hope it is as valuable to you as it is to me. And of course you can easily disable it if you ever feel the need to have your say.\r\n\r\nNote that this does not prevent people from leaving comments. It does prevent \"you\" from leaving comments and seeing the comments of others. It's not a security feature, it's a productivity enhancement ...if such a thing can be said about Facebook I guess.",
