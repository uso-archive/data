This is mostly for options you really don't normally want to take. You can disable this style temporarily to enable the button. You can also edit the css directly if you want a button to appear permanently; the comments in the css show exactly which button is on what line.\r\n\r\nThis style works with the June 2018 redesign.","user":{"id":17532,"name":"Corran","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2018-06-07T22:56:52.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":180,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/160990_after.jpeg?r=1597392577","url":"/styles/160990/fallen-london-remove-specific-go-buttons","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"fallenlondon.com\") {\r\n/* Removes GO button from these storylets */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"119965\"] .button--primary, /* An unsigned message - Legendary Charisma */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"119967\"] .button--primary, /* An unsigned message - Invisible Eminence */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"119963\"] .button--primary, /* An unsigned message - Extraordinary Mind */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"119968\"] .button--primary, /* An unsigned message - Shattering Force */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"110659\"] .button--primary, /* An unsigned message - Will you execute our denouement? */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"7219\"] .button--primary, /* Rat Melancholy - Perhaps she was happiest before */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"11115\"] .button--primary, /* The Rewards of Intrigue - Memory is a strange old thing */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"63707\"] .button--primary, /* Sell the location of the Cave of the Nadir */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"63708\"] .button--primary, /* Sell the location of the Cave of the Nadir */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"63709\"] .button--primary, /* Sell the location of the Cave of the Nadir */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"63710\"] .button--primary, /* Sell the location of the Cave of the Nadir */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"120887\"] .button--primary, /* Invite the Green-Eyed Devil to your Sanctum for a snifter. */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"120738\"] .button--primary, /* A visit from Slowcake's Amanuensis - Throw the Amanuensis out on his oily little ear */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"120139\"] .button--primary, /* The Tower of Knives: Difficulties at a Smoky Flophouse - Ambush Smugglers */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"57935\"] .button--primary, /* Rob a drunk - A spirifer? */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"120137\"] .button--primary /* The Sleepless Tower: Disturbances at a Cottage by the Observatory - Invite guests from the observatory to a symposium */\r\n{\r\n    display: none;\r\n}\r\n}"}
