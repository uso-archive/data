{"id":2178,"name":"MySpace Ad/Annoyance Remover","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"myspace","subcategory":"myspace","style_tags":[],"description":"This user style removes all of the ads (those that I've found) and annoying elements (Cool New People, Featured Artist, etc...) that appear on myspace.com that distract you or inhibit you while you use myspace.com. I've taken care not to interfere with the user’s ability to continue to use the site normally. I plan to continuously update this style for ads that are created by profile generators. If there are any questions, suggestions or issues, please refer to:\r\n\r\nhttp://userstyles.org/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=164\r\n\r\nThat is where you will get the best support. If you have the time, please rate this user style.\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n---------------\r\n2.0.0\r\n- Code now better reflects changes to MySpace.\r\n- Fixed issue with Firefox 3 Beta 5 still showing ads on the login page.\r\n- Removed code that removed annoyances left by page generators. This will be added back as soon as I rework things. This, like I always said, is where your help is most needed. Please submit your annoyances that you would like to remove. \r\n\r\n1.6.0\r\n - Cleaned up the code reducing the size to 8KB.\r\n\r\n1.5.0\r\n - Updated for code changes to MySpace and new skins.\r\n - Tweaked login page and classic skin\r\n\r\n1.0.0\r\n - Fixed (sorta...) the header on the new MySpace TV page.","user":{"id":2365,"name":"Urban Legend","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-05-12T13:31:46.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":4877,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/2178_after.png?r=1589357004","url":"/styles/2178/myspace-ad-annoyance-remover","discussionsCount":4,"commentsCount":4,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"myspace.com\") {\r\n\r\n/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMySpace Ad/Annoyance Remover 2.0\r\nCreated: 20080502\r\nLast Edited: 20080502\r\nWritten by: Kwasi Bunsie\r\nAll Rights Reserved\r\nQuestions, suggestions or issues?
