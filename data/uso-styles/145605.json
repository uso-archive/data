  "additional_info": "2018/01/19 - CSS classes changed drastically and forced a complete rewrite. Style was updated accordingly. I did it kind of fast, but I think it's working fine!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2017/10/13 - It was easier than I envisioned to update this theme, so... updated to work with the new site! And no issue with rewards backgrounds because of how the new site's CSS works!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2017/09/29 - This no longer works after the site update. If I remake it, I will probably start it from scratch, so this might be archived soon.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCode is really messy (because it was originally envisioned with more functionality, which it might get later). May need some hammering out and fixing later\r\n\r\nKnown issue: The background of the title of rewards in edit mode is yellow. I believe this is because rewards technically have a value? I tried all the ways that should have logically fixed it, but I couldn't get it to fix, so I'm posting it as-is.",
