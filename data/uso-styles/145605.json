{"id":145605,"name":"Habitica All-Yellow Tasks","description":"A style that makes all tasks yellow, unless they're complete/not-due (grey) or rewards. Cobbled together quickly, so there might be an error somewhere, but I've tested it and haven't found any in the latest version!","user":{"id":462168,"name":"citrusella","email":"citrusellaflugpucker@yahoo.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2018-01-19T19:56:00.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":403,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/145605_after.png?r=1687507280","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"publicdomain","created":"2017-07-24T00:51:06.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"habitica","subcategory":"habitica","additional_info":"2018/01/19 - CSS classes changed drastically and forced a complete rewrite. Style was updated accordingly. I did it kind of fast, but I think it's working fine!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2017/10/13 - It was easier than I envisioned to update this theme, so... updated to work with the new site! And no issue with rewards backgrounds because of how the new site's CSS works!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2017/09/29 - This no longer works after the site update. If I remake it, I will probably start it from scratch, so this might be archived soon.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCode is really messy (because it was originally envisioned with more functionality, which it might get later). May need some hammering out and fixing later\r\n\r\nKnown issue: The background of the title of rewards in edit mode is yellow. I believe this is because rewards technically have a value? I tried all the ways that should have logically fixed it, but I couldn't get it to fix, so I'm posting it as-is.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"habitica.com\") {\r\n  .task-neutral-control-bg,.task-good-control-bg,.task-better-control-bg,.task-best-control-bg,.task-bad-control-bg,.task-worse-control-bg,.task-worst-control-bg {\r\n\t  background: #FFBE5D !important;\r\n  }\r\n  .task-neutral-control-inner-daily-todo,.task-good-control-inner-daily-todo,.task-better-control-inner-daily-todo,.task-best-control-inner-daily-todo,.task-bad-control-inner-daily-todo,.task-worse-control-inner-daily-todo,.task-worst-control-inner-daily-todo {\r\n\t  background: #FFD9A0 !important;\r\n  }\r\n  .task-neutral-control-inner-habit,.task-good-control-inner-habit,.task-better-control-inner-habit,.task-best-control-inner-habit,.task-bad-control-inner-habit,.task-worse-control-inner-habit,.task-worst-control-inner-habit {\r\n\tbackground: rgba(183, 90, 28, 0.32) !important;\r\n  }\r\n  .task-neutral-control-bg:hover .habit-control,.task-good-control-bg:hover .habit-control,.task-better-control-bg:hover .habit-control,.task-best-control-bg:hover .habit-control,.task-bad-control-bg:hover .habit-control,.task-worse-control-bg:hover .habit-control,.task-worst-control-bg:hover .habit-control {\r\n\tbackground: #bf7d1a !important;\r\n  }\r\n  .task-neutral-control-checkbox,.task-good-control-checkbox,.task-better-control-checkbox,.task-best-control-checkbox,.task-bad-control-checkbox,.task-worse-control-checkbox,.task-worst-control-checkbox {\r\n      color: #FFBE5D !important;\r\n  }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/145605/habitica-all-yellow-tasks.user.js","style_settings":[]}
