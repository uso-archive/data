  "description": "Compresses the separator between the Theme Listing and the Theme Preview.... Increasing the size of your Themes List\r\nThis resize panel allows you to shorten or lengthen the preview area of the extensions, but it is a bit big, so this code fixes the problem!\r\n\r\n** This is an original style.  I searched for splitter, separator, and resize before posting and came up empty for similar styles.  The only style I was able to find was Style 8930 by user 7858\r\n\r\nIntegrates with the Following Styles:\r\n+ Style 8930\r\n\r\nWorks on the following browsers:\r\n+ Firefox 3\r\n+ Firefox 2 also\r\n+ Gives you approximately 6 more pixels to your Installed Themes Preview window.  (notice in the screenshot - the Vertical bar in the middle.  That is what is being affected)\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n- Initial Release",
