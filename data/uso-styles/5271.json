{"id":5271,"name":"CasualCollective_layout-tweaks","description":"* Very roughly re-centers Casual Collective. Mostly 'cause I don't want to muck around with making center proper work. Will use 50% down to the 935px minimum width.\r\n* Moves profile controls to the right. Just 'cause.\r\n\r\nIf you know of a way to select the tabs and icon with css (as there are no identifying marks on those elements,) please let me know so I can move those as well.\r\n\r\nCenter job is very rough. Casual Collective's page structure is _not_conducive to user styling.\r\n\r\nNote: Requires browser support of the '\u003e' (child) selector.
