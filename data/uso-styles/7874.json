{"id":7874,"name":"Reinstate normal cursor, hide animated fencer","description":"This style deactivates the custom heart cursor used on this site and reinstates the more usual pointer. \r\nIt also hides the images of the fencing man that trail around the screen after the pointer. The latter effect is achieved on the site using Javascript, which cannot be selectively disabled (i.e if you disable Javascript in your browser you'll lose not be able to see stuff like like the site menu, which is also created using JavaScript). Therefore, this style hack simply hides the dynamically created DIVs that contain the image so the effect is not visible.","user":{"id":11091,"name":"ePVbdI","email":"stylish@elaborategrove.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-06-10T12:30:55.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":163,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/7874-after.png?r=1675152012","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-06-10T12:30:55.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"londonfencingclub","subcategory":"londonfencingclub","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"londonfencingclub.co.uk\") {\r\n    body,p,td,input,select,textarea, .sword{\r\n       cursor:default;\r\n    }\r\n    #CUR0, #CUR1, #CUR2, #CUR3, #CUR4{\r\n       display:none;\r\n    }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/7874/reinstate-normal-cursor-hide-animated-fencer.user.js","style_settings":[]}
