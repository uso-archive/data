{"id":3759,"name":"fsdaily.com","description":"FSdaily please don't put the ads on the left, they destroy the page. Please place you're ads in a less jarring location, so it doesn't interrupt the content. :) Thanks. To use this you need also the firefox adblock add-on. This style will increase the size of the content area, hide the breadcrumb, as well as shift the content so it aligns flush left. I am also rocking the Firefox Nasa theme, if you wanted to know.","user":{"id":4396,"name":"braydonfuller","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-10-10T19:27:31.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":91,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3759_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-10-10T19:27:31.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"fsdaily","subcategory":"fsdaily","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(fsdaily.com) {\r\n  .news-summary {left:-175px; width:125%;}\r\n  #wrap2 {left:0px;}\r\n  #breadcrumbs {display:none;}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/3759/fsdaily-com.user.js","style_settings":[]}
