{"id":9725,"name":"Block Animated Favicons","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","style_tags":[],"description":"Disable the annoying animated favicons that appear on certain websites.\r\n\r\nWhat does it do? (Features):\r\n- Removes animated fav icons from the URLBar (left of the awesome bar) where the site identity button is\r\n- Prevents animated icons in the awesome bar list\r\n- Prevents animated favicons from becoming your bookmarks icons (either in bookmarks toolbar OR bookmarks menu)\r\n- Prevents animated favicons from appearing in your Back / Forward history menus\r\n- This style ONLY blocks animated (GIF) favicons... Don't worry, this style will not ruin your website viewing experience, it will make it better!\r\n\r\n\r\nThese can be very distracting and idiotic.\r\n\r\n** This code was taken from Lifehacker, which was taken from The How-To Geek (http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/lifehacker/full/~3/365590909/how-to-block-distracting-animated-favicons)\r\n\r\nTEST THIS STYLE HERE:\r\nhttp://dhl-usa.com/home/home.asp\r\n\r\n** You may need to Refresh the Page and/or reset your browser for this to work.\r\n\r\nRemove Annoyances!\r\n\r\nIntegrated Styles:\r\n+ Try out Style 9729 to make YOUR OWN animated favicon on a loading tab!\r\n\r\nCall for help:\r\nTry this website: http://favicons.pouessel.org/frame.html    Everything is working fine, except for the bookmarking.  If you bookmark this page, it will display an animation... I tried to code a block for it, but It would not block, any help would be great!\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.4:\r\n+ BUGFIX: Site identity for sites that change the name of the .gif now fixed.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.3:\r\n+ BUGFIX: Above, I mentioned that you can rename a .gif to .ico and it will still animate and not be blocked.  Well, I managed to hack in a way to check if it has been renamed, and this update will prevent those types of favicons (looks at content type).  - Test this update here (http://favicons.pouessel.org/frame.html)\r\n= Expect one more update soon, that will do the same, but for the site-identity button.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.2:\r\n+ BUGFIX: There was a bug where the icon shows up in the tab's favicon (tab bar) - now NO animated favicons of websites show up on any part of the browser!\r\n\r\n1.0.0.1:\r\n+ Now working perfectly, thanks to user 13489's Fix (will be global style now).\r\n+ Moved out of obsolete mode, now that the style is working","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-08-15T16:07:19.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":998,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/9725_after.png?r=1579248072","url":"/styles/9725/block-animated-favicons","discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":5,"css":"/*\r\n ___________________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                        |\r\n|          Title:  |  Block Animated Favicons                               |\r\n|    Description:  |  Remove Annoyances, remove animations                  |\r\n|         Author:  |  The How-To Geek (Posted on userstyles by -=Ben=-)     |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  August 14, 2008                                       |\r\n|   Date Updated:  |  August 15, 2008                                       |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.4                                               |\r\n|__________________|________________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n.bookmark-item[image*=\"favicon.gif\"] .menu-iconic-icon,\r\n.bookmark-item[image*=\"favicon.gif\"] .toolbarbutton-icon\r\n.bookmark-item[image*=\"favicon.gif\"]:not([container]) .menu-iconic-icon,\r\n.bookmark-item[image*=\"favicon.gif\"]:not([container]) .toolbarbutton-icon \r\n.tab-icon-image[image*=\"favicon.gif\"],\r\n.tab-icon-image[image*=\"gif\"],\r\n.tab-icon-image[src*=\"gif\"],\r\n.tab-icon-image[src*=\"favicon.gif\"]\r\n{\r\n  width: 0 !important; padding-left: 16px !important;\r\n  background: transparent url(chrome://global/skin/icons/folder-item.png)  no-repeat !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n#page-proxy-favicon[src$=\"favicon.gif\"],\r\n#page-proxy-favicon[src*=\"gif\"], \r\ntab[image$=\"favicon.gif\"] .tab-icon\r\n{\r\n  width: 0 !important; padding-left: 16px !important;\r\n}\r\n"}
