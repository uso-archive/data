{"id":157237,"name":"Fix for MS Edge with Dark Windows Visual Style","description":"Microsoft Edge uses Windows theme colors for its default CSS. If a user installs a custom visual style for Windows, then Edge may use incorrect colors for certain default CSS elements. For example, white elements may appear as dark gray when using a dark Windows theme. This fix resets the background and text color of affected elements back to black on white. Use the Tampermonkey Edge extension from the Windows Store to apply.","user":{"id":117473,"name":"pkchris","email":"pkchris@gmail.com","paypal_email":"pkchris@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":"I spend most of my time playing video games, hanging out with friends, going to school and working.
