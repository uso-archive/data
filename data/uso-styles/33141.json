{"id":33141,"name":"Delicious.com - Hide \"Send To\" Field","description":"I find that having the \"send to\" field in Delicious.com's save page can sometimes get in the way of Delicious.com's tag completion when you hit the Tab key; instead of completing the tag, it takes you to the \"send to\" field.  Since I only rarely use Delicious.com's send-to functionality, this userscript hides it.","user":{"id":2444,"name":"WCityMike","email":"mikeharris19@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"updated":"2010-07-02T12:39:52.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":161,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/33141-after.png?r=1675670412","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-07-02T12:39:52.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"delicious","subcategory":"delicious","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://delicious.com/save\") {\r\n#sendfield\r\n{\r\ndisplay: none !important\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/33141/delicious-com-hide-send-to-field.user.js","style_settings":[]}
