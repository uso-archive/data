This hacky method comes at a cost, though: because of the way the code is structured, the \"View x replies\" button can't be hidden on Justin Y's comments specifically. To remedy this, this button is hidden by default until you hover over its respective parent comment. You can't hover over comments that are hidden with this style, so you won't see Justin Y's comments even accidentally.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"youtube.com\") {\r\n.comment-thread-renderer {margin: 0 10px 0px 0!important;}\r\n.comment-thread-renderer .comment-action-buttons-toolbar:nth-of-type(1) {margin-bottom: 15px!important;}\r\n.comment-replies-renderer-header {position: relative!important; bottom: 19px!important;}\r\n.spf-link[href*=\"jeyoung624\"], .spf-link[href*=\"jeyoung624\"] + *, .spf-link[href*=\"jeyoung624\"] + * + *, .spf-link[href*=\"jeyoung624\"] * + * + *, .spf-link[href*=\"jeyoung624\"] + * + * + * + * {display: none!important;}\r\n.comment-replies-renderer {height: 1px!important; transition: .1s!important; overflow: hidden!important;}\r\n.comment-thread-renderer:hover .comment-replies-renderer {height: auto!important; overflow: visible!important; transition: .1s!important;}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/167296/hide-justin-y-s-comments-on-youtube.user.js","style_settings":[]}
