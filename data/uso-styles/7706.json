{"id":7706,"name":"Compress Bookmarks Toolbar Items","description":"Greatly condenses the Bookmarks Toolbar.  Removes padding, making the toolbar very small and minimal.  Excellent style for those who want to conserve screen real-estate.  Works on Firefox2 AND Firefox3 !!\r\n\r\n* Thanks user 3934 for the update for the margins!\r\n\r\nThis style allows you to fit more Bookmarks on your toolbar.  Buttons on the Favorites Toolbar will be closer together (smaller Size).\r\n\r\nApplies to:\r\n- Firefox 3\r\n- Firefox 2 \r\n\r\nGives you a larger area, and more screenspace for your browser.\r\nWorks for BOTH Firefox 3 AND Firefox 2.\r\nWhy install an extension to do this, when you can do it through CSS!?\r\n\r\nIntegrates with Style 7463, and Style 7461.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.1:\r\n+ Added Margin shorthand property content.  This GREATLY reduces the bookmarks toolbar, squishing the icons together.  Thanks to Lain_13 for the code \u0026 suggestion.  Continue to suggest on my styles, I am open to suggestions, and glad to write a new style if you want!","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"benbenben3@msn.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-06-05T12:51:38.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":3885,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/7706_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-06-02T14:10:46.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                    |\r\n|          Title:  |  Compress Bookmarks Toolbar Items                  |\r\n|    Description:  |  Condenses Bookmarks Toolbar for more space        |\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                           |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  June 2, 2008                                      |\r\n|   Last Updated:  |  June 5, 2008                                      |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.1                                           |\r\n|__________________|____________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.bookmark-item \u003e .toolbarbutton-icon \r\n{\r\n  margin: 0px 1px 0px -3px !important;\r\n  padding: 0px !important;\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":8765,"name":"Good, but with this -- better... for me.\n\n  marg","rating":3,"created":"2008-06-05T09:43:02.000Z","author_name":"Lain_13","author_id":3934},{"id":11410,"name":"Awesome, this is just what I needed.
