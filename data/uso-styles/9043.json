In the meantime so that you can at least use the address portion of the address bar install \"The Addon Bar (restored)\"\r\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/the-addon-bar/  ****  \r\n\r\nThe  \"Tab Counter\" extension count can be moved to the tabs bar in Firefox 4.0, and the counter can be styled to provide a larger number with very little padding, so is included with this style. https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tab-counter/\r\n\r\nThe Before picture includes use of the \"Tab Counter\" extension.\r\n\r\nThe After Picture shows results after using the following three styles.\r\n style 24728 (24728),\r\n style 10170 (10170)\r\n style 9043 (9043),\r\n style 18553 (18553)\r\n\r\nThe tool tips (#content spacer),  and the tabs drop down (#content stack[pack=end])  are  left intact where one can see the full tab names.  If any update after Fx 3.6 destroys tabs drop down to show pictures instead of the titles, you may be forced to use \"Tabs Menu\" extension (addon/1242). \r\n\r\nFor more information on \"Tabbed Browsing in Firefox\" see http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/tabs.htm \r\n\r\nI would recommend the following settings in your about:cofing settings which are described in http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config_entries \r\n\r\nuser_pref(\"browser.tabs.closeButtons\", 3);\r\nuser_pref(\"browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab\", false);\r\nuser_pref(\"browser.tabs.tabClipWidth\", 5);\r\nuser_pref(\"browser.tabs.tabMinWidth\", 0);\r\nuser_pref(\"browser.tabs.warnOnClose\", true);\r\nuser_pref(\"browser.tabs.warnOnOpen\", true);   \r\n\r\nThe curved appearance of tabs could be completely removed (flattened), as seen in style 13326.\r\n.tabbrowser-tabs  \t{-moz-appearance: none !important;  background-color: transparent !important;  background-image: none !important;}\r\n\r\nFor best viewing of the Before and After pictures install my style 12373 (12373), so you will  be viewing actual sizes if your window is at least 510px wide.   The actual images are life-size images grabbed from the screen before 409x32px  and after as 410x18px  showing a reduction to 56% of the original height, and as you can see more of the wording appears in the same width.\r\n\r\nIf you do not see the before and after image they can be seen at:\r\nhttp://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/9043_before.png\r\nhttp://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/9043_after.png\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a companion for  style 24728 (24728) by user 12592, which shows active tab with red underscore, previously viewed with  blue underscore, and unread with a green underscore.  For earlier versions of Firefox prior to 3.6 use  style 9023 (9023) instead.   Styles I use can be seen at  http://kb.mozillazine.org/User:Dmcritchie\r\n \r\nRemoving  the New tab button from tabs bar added by Fx 3.5, suggest you drag New Tab button from customize so you can have it on one of the other toolbars again. (hiding tabs newtab button is now implemented into this style)\r\n/* Hide the tab container's New Tab button */\r\n.tabs-newtab-button {  display: none !important; }\r\n\r\n/* Remove left and right scroll buttons which appear at 70 tabs, and disappear \r\n   again at 68 tabs -- tabs get smaller and will never scroll with this setup */\r\n.scrollbutton-up, .scrollbutton-down {display: none !important;}\r\n\r\n---\r\nRemove browser.tabs.tabMinWidth and browser.tabs.tabMaxWidth in favor of CSS https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=574654\r\n---\r\n\r\nIncompatibilities:\r\n*\"Retitler\" extension (addons 7863)  will not permit decreased tab width until you uncheck \"use more flexible tab width\" in the add-on's options -\u003e settings (tab).  (even setting it's minwidth to 0 would not work)\r\n\r\n*Firefox \"New Tab\" ([+]) button will disappear on tab strip due to suppression of horizontal tab scrolling when the button is not next to list-all-tab, or close-tab, but is placed to the left of the \"Tabs Count\" extension button.(Q829965)  Not a problem for me as I would use Ctrl+Tab or another tool bar instead of losing valuable real estate on the tabs bar.\r\n\r\nAlternatives:\r\nThis style is mainly about minimizing the tabs bar footprint and to remove scrolling.  For those that don't want to minimize and want to retain scrolling but don't like the method of scrolling for a new tab\r\n\r\ntoolkit.scrollbox.smoothScroll\r\nWhen more tabs are present on the tab strip than can be displayed at once, the tab strip becomes scrollable to handle the overflow. Switching to another tab that is not currently in view will cause the tab strip to scroll so that the tab is visible. This preference determines whether to scroll the new tab into view smoothly, or to have it snap into view. \r\n\r\n\r\nUpdates: (see code,  browser.tabs.tabMinWidth  must be set to 0 in about:config)\r\n2008-07-31 @namespace added so works on AMO site  (repeat of same  change ~ 2008-07-29)\r\n2008-11-10 max-height  increased to 17px to work better with style #9023 color underscores\r\n2009-08-06 remove useless tab bar newtab button (FF 3.5) \r\n2009-09-26 remove left and right scroll buttons that appear at 70 tabs, and disappear again at 68 tabs (FF 3.5)\r\n2011-04-14 styling for \"Tab Counter\" extension\r\n2011-10-27 reduce wasted space right/left of app-tabs icon (production on 2011-11-13)","style_tags":[],"css":"/* Tabs Bar Minimal Size  - David McRitchie (DM*)  */\r\n/* ===================================================== */\r\n/* companion for style 9023 - Tab Color markings active/read/unread (DM*) */\r\n/* David McRitchie,  2008-07-25, updated 2008-07-31 @namespace  */\r\n/* 2008-11-10 max-height 17px to work better with style 9023 color underscores*/\r\n/* 2009-08-06 remove useless tab bar newtab button (FF 3.5) */\r\n/* 2009-09-26 remove left and right scroll buttons appearing while 69 \u0026 70 tabs */\r\n/* 2011-04-14 styling for \"Tab Counter\" extension */\r\n/* 2011-10-27 reduce wasted space right/left of app-tabs icon */\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n/* Change width of tabs*  -- also requires \r\n   browser.tabs.tabMinWidth  set to 0 in about:config */\r\n.tabbrowser-tabs *|tab {    \r\n    font-size: 10px !important;\r\n    height:    12px !important;\r\n    min-width: 8px !important  }\r\n/* reduce wastes space in all tabs, reduces app-tabs width by 1/3 */\r\n.tab-icon-image {\r\nmargin-left: 1px !important;\r\nmargin-right: 1px !important; }\r\n\r\n/* \"Tab Counter\" Extension  can be moved to the tab bar in Fx4.0 */\r\n#tabcounter-toolbar-item {font-size:12px; font-weight:700 !important; \r\n margin:0px !important; padding:0px 2px 0px 2px !important;background-color: yellow !important;  border:1px solid black !important;}\r\n\r\n/* ChoGGi 2007-09-13 minimum size for tabs \r\n   http://userstyles.org/forum/comments.php?DiscussionID=492\u0026page=1#Item_5 */\r\n#content spacer,.tabs-bottom{display:none!important}\r\n#content *{margin:0!important;padding:0 0 0 0px!important}\r\ntab\u003e.tab-image-middle,tab,tabs{max-height:17px!important}\r\n\r\n\r\n/* Hide the new tab button in the tab bar   - Firefox 3.5 */\r\n.tabs-newtab-button {display: none;}\r\n\r\n/* Remove left and right scroll buttons which appear at 70 tabs, and disappear \r\n   again at 68 tabs -- tabs get smaller and will never scroll with this setup */\r\n.scrollbutton-up, .scrollbutton-down {display: none !important;}","discussions":[{"id":9725,"name":"it works great","rating":3,"created":"2008-07-31T10:48:18.000Z","author_name":"Lain_13","author_id":3934},{"id":12509,"name":"marvelous","rating":3,"created":"2009-05-28T07:48:53.000Z","author_name":"riow","author_id":3086},{"id":23886,"name":"Grey tab bar border on bottom gone!
