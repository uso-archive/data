{"id":87568,"name":"Twitch no chat and full width","description":"Disables the Twitch.tv chat and applies full width in place of the chatbox.\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nYou may want to prevent yourself from spoilers concerning tv-shows and movies, also prevents you from seeing overall stupidity and anonimity around that place.\r\n\r\nWhy it's useful:\r\nEverytime you enter a twitch channel you're welcomed by the chat box, and then you have to click on it's settings and disable it. Remember that even before you click fullscreen-mode you might have already been spoiler'ed or struck by the stupidity.","user":{"id":189235,"name":"bwillow","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2013-05-15T12:27:41.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":385,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/87568_after.jpeg?r=1683878414","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2013-05-15T12:27:41.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"twitch","subcategory":"twitch","additional_info":"Applies display: none and margin-right: 0 for 2 elements, including !important attributes.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"twitch.tv\") {\r\n#main_col {\r\n    margin-right: 0 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#right_col {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":48686,"name":"Thank you!","rating":3,"created":"2016-02-06T04:53:15.000Z","author_name":"Purple Tentacle","author_id":313657}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/87568/twitch-no-chat-and-full-width.user.js","style_settings":[]}
