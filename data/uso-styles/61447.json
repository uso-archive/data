(Since the player is now 1280 pixels wide, a resolution bigger than that is advised to use the medium size of the player, if you have a resolution of 1280 pixels or even smaller just use the full screen size.)\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nSome features and things you may like to know...\r\n- This script intented only to resize the defaults player sizes, no other unnecessarily change was made.\r\n- To finish, yes i know it could be a bit better than what it is, but sincerely i don't wanted spend more time with it!\r\n--------------------------------------------------","style_tags":[],"css":"/***\r\nYoutube - Bigger Player Sizes (v0.060) 23:24 03-12-2012\r\nby: Newtomic\r\nhttp://userstyles.org/styles/61447\r\n***/\r\n@-moz-document\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.youtube.com/watch),\r\nurl-prefix(https://www.youtube.com/watch),\r\nurl-prefix(http://youtube.com/watch),\r\nurl-prefix(https://youtube.com/watch)\r\n{\r\n#watch7-video #watch7-player {\r\n\twidth: 1280px !important;\r\n\theight: 750px !important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/61447/youtube-bigger-player-sizes.user.js","style_settings":[]}
