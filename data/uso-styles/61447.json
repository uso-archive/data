  "additional_info": "########## (v0.060) ##########\r\n- YouTube changed the code again, and this time i could not find a difference to resize the two player sizes separately so it just have one size 720p optimized, at least for now.\r\n\r\n########## (v0.050) ##########\r\n- Fixed and working with both players, Flash and HTML5.\r\n\r\n########## (v0.030) ##########\r\n- 1st public release.\r\n- Small size of player it's now optimized for 480p instead of 360p.\r\n- Medium size of player it's now optimized for 720p instead of 480p. (Since the player is now 1280 pixels wide, a resolution bigger than that is advised to use the medium size of the player, if you have a resolution of 1280 pixels or even smaller just use the full screen size.)\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nSome features and things you may like to know...\r\n- This script intented only to resize the defaults player sizes, no other unnecessarily change was made.\r\n- To finish, yes i know it could be a bit better than what it is, but sincerely i don't wanted spend more time with it!\r\n--------------------------------------------------",
