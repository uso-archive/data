  "description": "The redesign of RuneScape homepage brought unnecessary clutter to the page, main frustration being the \"Featured News\" box, which often shows outdated \"news\" and yet occupies a huge portion of the screen. For many users this means the newest updates aren't immediately visible and they have to scroll down to see them. The box itself isn't very helpful. This very simple style removes it - it's really nicer without.",
