(Fixed)\r\n+ Added proper code formatting (using case)\r\n+ Now works on sites such as Google","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-11-25T15:19:42.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1329,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/9895_after.png?r=1588665963","url":"/styles/9895/autopager-extension-transparent-popup-menus","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"css":"/*\r\n ___________________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                        |\r\n|          Title:  |  AutoPager Extension - Transparent Popup Menus         |\r\n|    Description:  |  AutoPager detects a page to stream - will be see-thru |\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                               |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  August 21, 2008                                       |\r\n|   Date Updated:  |  November 25, 2008                                     |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.2                                               |\r\n|__________________|________________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n/* Set the default transparency for the page options: */\r\ndiv.autoPagerS\r\n{\r\n  opacity:.5 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n/* Set the transparency when the page options are HOVERED OVER: */\r\ndiv.autoPagerS:hover\r\n{\r\n  opacity:.9 !important;\r\n}"}
