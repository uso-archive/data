{"id":14391,"name":"Default sans-serif for many sites (edit the list!)","description":"This user style simply forces the sans-serif from your browser configuration on all the text on a site (except on headlines, if the site has specifically styled them so – where a serif face is OK anyway). I use it to strip sites of Arial (eg. Google) or make designs readable that use not only tiny fonts but also serif fonts – often a sans-serif in the same point size will be readable on a screen where a serif is not, simply due to the low resolution of screens compared to paper.\r\n\r\nThis style is *meant* for editing: the list of sites I included is just an excerpt from the list for which I use it, and you should customise it to include whatever sites bother *you* with their awful typographic choices. You could even edit it to make it enforce your default serif… or edit it to enforce any *particular* typeface of your choice. Get wild, use it/abuse it as you wish.","user":{"id":913,"name":"Aristotle","email":"pagaltzis@gmx.de","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"updated":"2009-02-01T20:05:10.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":802,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/14391-after.png?r=1686556816","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"publicdomain","created":"2009-02-01T20:05:10.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"advogato","subcategory":"advogato","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/* AGENT_SHEET */\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document \r\ndomain(\"advogato.org\"),\r\ndomain(\"apache.org\"),\r\ndomain(\"artima.com\"),\r\ndomain(\"blogs.discovermagazine.com\"),\r\ndomain(\"blogspot.com\"),\r\ndomain(\"github.com\"),\r\ndomain(\"git-scm.com\"),\r\ndomain(\"google.com\"),\r\ndomain(\"groups.yahoo.com\"),\r\ndomain(\"joelonsoftware.com\"),\r\ndomain(\"heise.de\"),\r\ndomain(\"leo.org\"),\r\ndomain(\"newscientist.com\"),\r\ndomain(\"nytimes.com\"),\r\ndomain(\"search.cpan.org\")\r\n{\r\n  p, li, blockquote, div, td, th,\r\n  a, i, b, em, strong, abbr, acronym, span\r\n  { font-family: sans-serif !important }\r\n\r\n  pre,   code,   tt,   samp,   textarea,\r\n  pre *, code *, tt *, samp *, textarea *\r\n  { font-family: monospace !important }\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":67668,"name":"Simple and great!","rating":3,"created":"2018-07-03T08:20:04.000Z","author_name":"Piotr Sobieszczański","author_id":672855}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/14391/default-sans-serif-for-many-sites-edit-the-list.user.js","style_settings":[]}
