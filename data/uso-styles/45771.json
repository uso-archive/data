It removes background images, makes images almost invisible but more visible on mouse over, and hides all flash, java or other embedded applets. No one looking over your shoulder will be able to recognise the site you are browsing, and it will make fun sites look boring so that you can have fun without annoying your boss.","user":{"id":94937,"name":"wazzhome","email":"mike.michaeljc@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://wassname.org","about":"Theres a report on tv with some very bad news!
