This style is designed to hide text on AOL Basic, GMail old composer, Yahoo! Mail classic and Hotmail (moved from Write in Secrecy 2). If you have no immediate need for using basic clients, then this isn't the style for you; Check out \u003ca href=\"http://userstyles.org/styles/79174\"\u003eWrite in Secrecy 2\u003c/a\u003e instead.\r\n\r\nWhile Luckymouse this time didn't help out, I still give him props here because He helped me on the original I made, before I decided to really learn DOMi and get to grips with its interface.\r\nTips to ensure this style works to the best of its ability:\r\n\r\n* Make text/hidden objects visible when nobody is looking\r\n* Send plain text only -- No attachments or downloads that will alter the screen\r\n* QUICKLY correct spelling errors.\r\n* Occasionally do something else, and disable the mouse when away.\r\n\r\nI am bound to encounter other bugs and glitches, so feel free to leave comments suggesting improvements! While you can, PLEASE do not use this style for acts of evil and harm.","style_tags":[],"css":"/* Write in Secrecy (for basic and older webmail) */\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n   /* GMail (old compose) */\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"mail.google.com\")\r\n{\r\n.dK.nr:not(:hover),\r\n.ez.nr:not(:hover),\r\n.editable.LW-avf:not(:hover)\r\n{\r\ncolor: transparent !important;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n   /* Hotmail (old Live mail) */\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"mail.live.com\")\r\n{\r\n.InputUL:not(:hover),\r\n#fSubject:not(:hover),\r\n.RichText:not(:hover)\r\n{\r\nopacity: 0 !important;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n   /* AOL Mail (Basic) */\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"mail.aol.com\")\r\n{\r\n#To:not(:hover),\r\n#Subject:not(:hover),\r\n#RichBody:not(:hover)\r\n{\r\ncolor: transparent !important;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n   /* Yahoo!
