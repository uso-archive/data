{"id":124052,"name":"YouTube - Music Mode - No Thumbs - Hide Vids - SFW","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"youtube","subcategory":"youtube","style_tags":[],"description":"No thumbnails, no video player, no footer, no comments. You just want to use Youtube as a radio. Pairs well with plugins like uBlockOrigin (or any decent ad blocker). I test my userstyle CSS while I have DarkTube (https://userstyles.org/styles/117673/darktube) enabled as well to make sure it's compatible.\r\n\r\nThis is an especially useful style when you're trying to listen to hip hop, rap, electronica since every thumbnail and video is all t&a which makes it hard to watch at work.\r\n\r\nupdated 16 March 2016: video controls don't autohide. Also each video summary now contains the video duration, which was lost when I removed the thumbnails originally.","user":{"id":287600,"name":"unchris","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-03-17T03:39:27.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":278,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/124052_after.png?r=1594973387","url":"/styles/124052/youtube-music-mode-no-thumbs-hide-vids-sfw","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":2,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.youtube.com\") {\r\n  \r\n  /* this makes sure you can still see how long the video is */\r\n  .accessible-description {\r\n    display: unset !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  /* get rid of all the damn thumbnails */\r\n  .thumb-wrapper {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  /* make sure the sidebar is at the right height */\r\n  #watch7-sidebar {\r\n    margin-top: unset !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  /* push over the content now that the thumbs are gone */\r\n  .content-wrapper {\r\n    margin-left: 0 !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  .yt-thumb { display: none !important; }\r\n  \r\n  #player-api { height: 50px !important; min-height: 0 !important;}\r\n  #movie-player { height: 50px !important; min-height: 0 !important;}\r\n  .html5-video-container { display: none !important;}\r\n  .video-stream { display: none;}\r\n  .ytp-iv-video-content { display: none;}\r\n  .player-height {height: 50px !important;  min-height: 0 !important;}\r\n  \r\n  #watch-discussion { display: none; }\r\n  \r\n  #footer-container { display: none; }\r\n  \r\n  #body-container { padding-bottom: 0 }\r\n  \r\n  .watch-sidebar { margin-top: 50px !important; }\r\n  \r\n  /* force video controls to always be visible */\r\n  .ytp-chrome-bottom {\r\n    opacity: 1.0 !important;\r\n  }\r\n}"}
