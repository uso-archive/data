{"id":124052,"name":"YouTube - Music Mode - No Thumbs - Hide Vids - SFW","description":"No thumbnails, no video player, no footer, no comments. You just want to use Youtube as a radio. Pairs well with plugins like uBlockOrigin (or any decent ad blocker). I test my userstyle CSS while I have DarkTube (https://userstyles.org/styles/117673/darktube) enabled as well to make sure it's compatible.\r\n\r\nThis is an especially useful style when you're trying to listen to hip hop, rap, electronica since every thumbnail and video is all t\u0026a which makes it hard to watch at work.\r\n\r\nupdated 16 March 2016: video controls don't autohide. Also each video summary now contains the video duration, which was lost when I removed the thumbnails originally.","user":{"id":287600,"name":"unchris","email":"unchris@outlook.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2016-03-17T03:39:27.000Z","weekly_install_count":2,"total_install_count":507,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/124052_after.png?r=1687593692","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"publicdomain","created":"2016-02-08T16:01:39.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"youtube","subcategory":"youtube","additional_info":"Submit pull requests at https://gitlab.com/unchris/userstyles","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.youtube.com\") {\r\n  \r\n  /* this makes sure you can still see how long the video is */\r\n  .accessible-description {\r\n    display: unset !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  /* get rid of all the damn thumbnails */\r\n  .thumb-wrapper {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  /* make sure the sidebar is at the right height */\r\n  #watch7-sidebar {\r\n    margin-top: unset !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  /* push over the content now that the thumbs are gone */\r\n  .content-wrapper {\r\n    margin-left: 0 !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  .yt-thumb { display: none !important; }\r\n  \r\n  #player-api { height: 50px !important; min-height: 0 !important;}\r\n  #movie-player { height: 50px !important; min-height: 0 !important;}\r\n  .html5-video-container { display: none !important;}\r\n  .video-stream { display: none;}\r\n  .ytp-iv-video-content { display: none;}\r\n  .player-height {height: 50px !important;  min-height: 0 !important;}\r\n  \r\n  #watch-discussion { display: none; }\r\n  \r\n  #footer-container { display: none; }\r\n  \r\n  #body-container { padding-bottom: 0 }\r\n  \r\n  .watch-sidebar { margin-top: 50px !important; }\r\n  \r\n  /* force video controls to always be visible */\r\n  .ytp-chrome-bottom {\r\n    opacity: 1.0 !important;\r\n  }\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":49171,"name":"A few questions","rating":0,"created":"2016-03-16T08:08:02.000Z","author_name":"etrit","author_id":321929}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":2,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/124052/youtube-music-mode-no-thumbs-hide-vids-sfw.user.js","style_settings":[]}
