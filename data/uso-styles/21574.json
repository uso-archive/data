{"id":21574,"name":"Adobes DevNet Reversed","description":"I didn't liked the layout of Adobe's DevNet with the articles on the right side and information about the article on the left. I always found it very hard to read because on longer articles there was a huge white space on the left side. I changed this and switched the columns and also changed the font-family to sans-serif and reduced the line-height slightly.","user":{"id":6678,"name":"EarMaster","email":"god@offen-siv.de","paypal_email":"nico.wiedemann@gmx.de","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-10-06T12:09:00.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":149,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/21574_after.gif?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-10-06T12:09:00.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"adobe","subcategory":"adobe","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.adobe.com\") {\r\n  #article-C2 * {\r\n    line-height:1.5em!important;\r\n  }\r\n  #article-C2 {\r\n    float: none!important;\r\n    margin-left: 1em!important;\r\n    font-family:Calibri,Arial,sans-serif!important;\r\n  }\r\n  #article-C1 {\r\n    margin-right: 1em!important;\r\n    float: right!important;\r\n  }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/21574/adobes-devnet-reversed.user.js","style_settings":[]}
