Now there is an option to not use the filter, in case you are having this problem too. If brightness option is \"without\", brightness value can be ignored.\r\n\r\nfeatures:\r\nThis style provides a different eye protection, it will produce a dull grey overlay in every page. However there is a known issue that I still working to overcome¹.\r\n\r\nhow to choose values:\r\n\r\nBrightness: Is in decimals, define how dark the whole screen will be. Use small values, 1 is default luminosity. It may not work in every browser².\r\nOpacity: Defines how strong the dull effect will be, the lower the value more dullest it is.\r\nBackground: is in rgb, the higher the value the lighter the grey will be.\r\n\r\nexplanation:\r\n\r\nInstead using a image as overlay, as there is no way to do such ,each site has a different warp div name (or none at all), this style will change the html (by pseudo selector :root) background to grey, and then proceed to down the opacity of all its children. It also use brightness filter² to compliment the effect, in case you browser don't support it, you can simple readjust the values.\r\n\r\n¹known issues:\r\nSites that uses the background direct on html or embedded an image on it, will end with the pure grey background, crashing against the others elements. Eg: google.com\r\n\r\ncompatibility:\r\nUsing with light values I suppose it is compatible with another nightmode styles.\r\n\r\n¹see known issues\r\n²please refer to \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/brightness\"\u003e filter - CSS|MDN \u003c/a\u003e","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace html url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@namespace xul url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http://), url-prefix(https://), url-prefix(ftp://), url-prefix(file://), url-prefix(about://) {\r\n  \r\n:root{\r\n   /*[[with]]*/\r\n   opacity:/*[[opa]]*/ !important;\r\n   background: rgb(/*[[bac]]*/,/*[[bac]]*/,/*[[bac]]*/) !important;  \r\n \r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/113355/global-nightmode-experimental.user.js","style_settings":[{"id":444107,"style_id":113355,"install_key":"bri","label":"Brightness","ordinal":100,"setting_type":"text","style_setting_options":[{"id":1612442,"style_setting_id":444107,"label":"placeholder","value":"0.85","default":true,"ordinal":0,"install_key":"placeholder"}]},{"id":444108,"style_id":113355,"install_key":"opa","label":"Opacity","ordinal":101,"setting_type":"text","style_setting_options":[{"id":1612443,"style_setting_id":444108,"label":"placeholder","value":"0.7","default":true,"ordinal":0,"install_key":"placeholder"}]},{"id":444109,"style_id":113355,"install_key":"bac","label":"Background","ordinal":102,"setting_type":"text","style_setting_options":[{"id":1612444,"style_setting_id":444109,"label":"placeholder","value":"100","default":true,"ordinal":0,"install_key":"placeholder"}]},{"id":445079,"style_id":113355,"install_key":"with","label":"Brightness Option","ordinal":103,"setting_type":"dropdown","style_setting_options":[{"id":1614918,"style_setting_id":445079,"label":"With","value":" -webkit-filter: brightness(/*[[bri]]*/) !important;\r\n filter: brightness(/*[[bri]]*/) !important;","default":true,"ordinal":3,"install_key":"with"},{"id":1615053,"style_setting_id":445079,"label":"Without","value":"","default":false,"ordinal":4,"install_key":"without"}]}]}
