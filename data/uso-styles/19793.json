{"id":19793,"name":"GodofWar.com Community: No Times Roman","description":"---Back Story.\r\n\r\nI don't find \"Times Roman\" to be an ideal font to be used so extensively on a website as it is done at \"forums.godofwar.com\" \r\n\r\nFor some reason Lithium treats font accessibility at \"forums.playstation.com\" just like the Olympians treated Fire before it was brought down to the Mortals by Prometheus. \r\n\r\nGiven Prometheus story and my need to please my eyes, I decided to use the benefit of technology intead of a \"break and entering\" approach to satisfy my need.\r\n\r\nI'm sharing this with you guys with the hopes of helping others in the community, as well as, finding others with better CSS knowledge to improve upon this style.\r\n\r\nDo feel free to modify and improve upon this work. I don't mind as long as: \r\n\r\n  i) That it is done to improve the godofwar.com community.\r\n ii) That Credit is given to me, Xuchilbara. ^_~\r\n  \r\n\r\n---What It Does.\r\n\r\nThis Style will restyle the GodofWar.com community forum to change the default \"Times Roman\" font.\r\n\r\n---What Is Affected.\r\n\r\nOnly fonts displayed at \"forums.godofwar.com\" will get stylized to Tahoma. The set size for general text is 9pt\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n- If you want to use another font that better pleases your eyes, just edit the style and replace \"Tahoma\" with the name of the font you want to use.\r\n\r\nTools \u003e\u003e\u003e Add-ons \u003e\u003e\u003e User Styles\r\n\r\nNow select the Style and click \"Edit\"\r\n\r\n*Remember, Stylish lets you \"Preview\" your style before you \"Save\"  \r\n","user":{"id":26315,"name":"Xuchilbara","email":"sevenfactors@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/52572","about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"updated":"2009-07-29T20:40:30.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":896,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/19793_after.gif?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-07-27T03:45:27.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"godofwar","subcategory":"godofwar","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"forums.godofwar.com\") {\r\n\r\n/*\r\n * GodofWar.com Community: No Times Roman\r\n *\r\n * Version: 1.0\r\n * Author: Xuchilbara\r\n * http://forums.godofwar.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/49\r\n * --------------------------------------------------------------\r\n * Do feel free to modify and improve upon this work.
