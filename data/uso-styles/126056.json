Perfect for those pasting into apps like WorkFlowy - with no need for further cleaning up. \r\n\r\nI've widened the snippet area and filled in the black spaces to create one continuous, clean block of text with \"paragraph\" breaks.\r\n\r\nThis style is set to be active everywhere you visit, since that's the idea behind Highly. \r\n\r\nIf you're into copying snippets from Wikipedia, try this theme which hides superscript reference links from the article to clean things up before pasting:\r\n\r\nMinimalist \"Wikipedia 1911\":\r\n\r\nhttps://userstyles.org/styles/126057/minimalist-wikipedia-1911","user":{"id":322059,"name":"frankman777","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":"...\r\nI have a whole section on Stylish in my geeky 312-page WorkFlowy book, \r\n\"Do Way, Way More in WorkFlowy\":\r\nhttp://www.productivitymashup.com/do-way-way-more-in-workflowy/\r\n\r\nYou can find the WorkFlowy Academy (where I'm creating screencast tutorials) here:\r\nhttp://www.productivitymashup.com/workflowy-academy\r\n\r\nBlogger in residence at the WorkFlowy blog:\r\nhttps://blog.workflowy.com/\r\n\r\nMy own nerdy blog:\r\nhttp://www.productivitymashup.com/\r\n...","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-03-28T00:14:57.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":255,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/126056_after.png?r=1596182857","url":"/styles/126056/highly-highlighter","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/* i really want this to be global */\r\n\r\n\r\n/* THIS CODE HIDES SUPERFLUOUS DETAILS */\r\n.highly-highlights-list .highly-highlights-list-item .highly-content sup,\r\n.highly-inline,\r\n.highly-article-summary-current-highlighter-info {\r\n    Display: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* THIS CODE FORMATS THE WIDTH AND DIMENSIONS OF THE HIGHLIGHTS SNIPPET AREA */\r\n.highly-summary .highly-highlights-list {\r\n    background: white;\r\n    margin-left: -100px;\r\n    margin-right: -100px;\r\n    margin-bottom: -130px;\r\n}\r\n.highly-highlights-list .highly-highlights-list-item {\r\n    border-top: 1px solid #ffffff;\r\n    margin-top: 15px;\r\n}"}
