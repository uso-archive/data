{"id":126056,"name":"Highly Highlighter","description":"For those using the Highly Highlighter extension. \r\n\r\nBlogged about this on the WorkFlowy blog: http://snip.ly/uzbpd\r\n\r\nWhen hitting the \"Summary\" button to access multiple highlights from any web page, this style hides the superfluous information (such as the superscript highlight count at the end of each snippet).\r\n\r\nThis allows one to copy-paste just the page title along with the highlighted extracts in one go. Perfect for those pasting into apps like WorkFlowy - with no need for further cleaning up. \r\n\r\nI've widened the snippet area and filled in the black spaces to create one continuous, clean block of text with \"paragraph\" breaks.\r\n\r\nThis style is set to be active everywhere you visit, since that's the idea behind Highly. \r\n\r\nIf you're into copying snippets from Wikipedia, try this theme which hides superscript reference links from the article to clean things up before pasting:\r\n\r\nMinimalist \"Wikipedia 1911\":\r\n\r\nhttps://userstyles.org/styles/126057/minimalist-wikipedia-1911","user":{"id":322059,"name":"frankman777","email":"frankman777@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":"...\r\nI have a whole section on Stylish in my geeky 312-page WorkFlowy book, \r\n\"Do Way, Way More in WorkFlowy\":\r\nhttp://www.productivitymashup.com/do-way-way-more-in-workflowy/\r\n\r\nYou can find the WorkFlowy Academy (where I'm creating screencast tutorials) here:\r\nhttp://www.productivitymashup.com/workflowy-academy\r\n\r\nBlogger in residence at the WorkFlowy blog:\r\nhttps://blog.workflowy.com/\r\n\r\nMy own nerdy blog:\r\nhttp://www.productivitymashup.com/\r\n...","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2016-03-28T00:14:57.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":307,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/126056_after.png?r=1687593612","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/126056_additional_19320.png?r=1687593612"],"license":null,"created":"2016-03-28T00:12:47.000Z","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/* i really want this to be global */\r\n\r\n\r\n/* THIS CODE HIDES SUPERFLUOUS DETAILS */\r\n.highly-highlights-list .highly-highlights-list-item .highly-content sup,\r\n.highly-inline,\r\n.highly-article-summary-current-highlighter-info {\r\n    Display: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* THIS CODE FORMATS THE WIDTH AND DIMENSIONS OF THE HIGHLIGHTS SNIPPET AREA */\r\n.highly-summary .highly-highlights-list {\r\n    background: white;\r\n    margin-left: -100px;\r\n    margin-right: -100px;\r\n    margin-bottom: -130px;\r\n}\r\n.highly-highlights-list .highly-highlights-list-item {\r\n    border-top: 1px solid #ffffff;\r\n    margin-top: 15px;\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/126056/highly-highlighter.user.js","style_settings":[]}
