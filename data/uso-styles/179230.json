{"result":{"id":179230,"name":"Google search \"old style\"","description":"It modifies the google search results layout (with the favicon line):\r\n - swaps the 2 lines: the \"favicon\" line and the \"title\" line.\r\n - hides the favicon (if it still appears)\r\n - reduces the font size of the result blocks to 90%, which is closer to the old size (before 2019).\r\n\r\nThe screenshot above is from the userstyle version. In that version the modifications can be toggled, the zoom value is selectable. It has options to reduce whitespace by altering the line's height and the margin. It can also change the font used to display the results in case google messes with it (new 2021/01/20).\r\nThe fully configurable version is available on <a href=\"https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/395346-google-search-old-style\" target=\"_blank\">greasyfork</a>.
