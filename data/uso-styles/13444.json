{"id":13444,"name":"Lifehacker Comment Indention","description":"Moves the reply comments over when expanded. I wrote this style sheet because it's almost impossible to tell when the replies begin or end.\r\n\r\nUpdate (7/31/09): \r\nFixed again for the new layout. There are now comments in the CSS. This style can be loaded as a userscript into the developer version of chrome. There are now shadow borders around the comments.\r\n\r\nUpdate (3/13/09): \r\nShortly after the last update stylish updated and dropped use of \"offset.\" \r\nI have fixed by going back to using padding and by changing the overflow setting.\r\n\r\nUpdate (2/2/09): \r\nFixed the comment cutoff ugliness. You will need to tell stylish to \"use code as is\" because the style now uses \"offset\" instead of \"padding-left.\" Sorry about the inconvenience.","user":{"id":12204,"name":"amoose136","email":"amoose136@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-07-31T23:15:19.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":446,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/13444_after.png?r=1677312015","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-01-02T04:12:42.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"lifehacker","subcategory":"lifehacker","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"lifehacker.com\") {\r\n.toplevel_comment {\t\t\t\t/*______For any comment not in reply to another comment:_____*/\r\n\t-moz-border-radius: 5px;\t\t/* \u003c- Corners for Firefox */\r\n\t-webkit-border-radius: 5px;\t\t/* \u003c- Corners for Chrome and Safari */\r\n\t-moz-box-shadow: 0 0 5px #9d5;\t\t/* \u003c- Shadows for Firefox */\r\n\t-webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 5px #9d5;\t/* \u003c- Shadows for Chrome and Safari */\r\n}\r\n.replylevel_comment {\t\t\t\t/*________For reply comments:________*/\r\n\t-moz-border-radius: 3px;\t\t/* \u003c- Corners for Firefox */\r\n\t-webkit-border-radius: 3px;\t\t/* \u003c- Corners for Chrome and Safari */\r\n\t-moz-box-shadow: 0 0 3px #282;\t\t/* \u003c- Shadows for Firefox */\r\n\t-webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 3px #282;\t/* \u003c- Shadows for Chrome and Safari */\r\n\tmargin-left: 5em !important;\t\t/* \u003c- The actual reply shifter */\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":11531,"name":"Works great.
