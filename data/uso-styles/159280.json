{"id":159280,"name":"Dock Udacity Chat Button @ Bottom-Left Corner","description":"**UPDATE 3** Now includes regex code to ensure that this style is only applied to individual lesson pages (pages with \"/modules/\" in the URL) since the chat \u0026 mentor buttons don't interfere with the interface on the course overview pages. \r\n**UPDATE 2** Now includes code to dock the mentor chat window in the bottom-left as well, keeping it out of the way of the \"next\" button. \r\n**UPDATE 1** Now includes code to automatically hide the orange notification orb.\r\nA snippet of CSS that that moves the Udacity chat button down into the bottom-left corner of the browser window (adjacent to the Mentorship button). Now it's out of your way when you don't need it, and easily within reach when you do.","user":{"id":643051,"name":"James Bartlett","email":"jimmyb@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"updated":"2018-07-12T05:59:26.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":55,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/159280_after.png?r=1685347214","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"ccby","created":"2018-04-30T21:29:49.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"udacity","subcategory":"udacity","additional_info":"Several of the web development courses on Udacity have a built-in chat feature for communicating with fellow students and mentors. It's a useful feature, but sadly, the button to open the chat window is BIG, and it just hovers on the left edge of the browser window, obscuring several lines of the course navigation menu. It can't be dismissed, minimized, popped out, or disabled without changing the source code, so that's what we've done here.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document regexp(\"https://classroom\\\\.udacity\\\\.com/.*(/modules/).*\") {\r\n.index--sidebar-footer--T8FHI{text-align: left;font-size: 8px;}\r\n.index--community-container--lkPE5{bottom:-13px;left:-5px;position:fixed;z-index:11;}\r\n.index--container--2vP63{padding:0 0 0 20px;}\r\n.index--avatar--2PsVN{margin-left:45px;}\r\n.fixed-panels--fixed-panels--3v3cX {margin: 0 200px 0 10px;}\r\n.student-panel-container--right--fTnDU{height: 800px;width: 600px;}\r\n.student-panel-container--container--4OWUd{left:50%;}\r\n.title-bar--title-bar--3_Vqu{height:20;width:80px;background-color:#fff0;border-bottom:none;}\r\n.student-panel-container--right--fTnDU{background-color:#fff;}\r\n.minimized-panel--header--1bgzM{display:none;}\r\n.minimized-panel--minimized-panel--3P2Md{background-color:#fff0;}\r\n  \r\n/* \r\nThe following line of code hides the orange notification orb on the chat button.\r\nIf you prefer to see the notification when new messages arrive, simply either:\r\n\r\nDelete the line of code below, or...\r\n  \r\n...to comment it out, cut and paste this entire line from here... */\r\n\r\n.index--notification-circle--39wEy {display: none;}\r\n\r\n/* ... to right above here ↑↑ */\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/159280/dock-udacity-chat-button-bottom-left-corner.user.js","style_settings":[]}
