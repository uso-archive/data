It changes:\r\n\r\n1) the margin color\r\n2) the border size and color\r\n3) width and height\r\n\r\nThe width and height are set for the search results (indented and unindented) as seen on a resolution of 1680x1050.  I might suggest that you play around with these values to better suit your needs, especially if you have a screen resolution different from that.\r\n\r\nI might suggest that you apply this in combination with one of my other styles style 2535, which does not break this style's layout.\r\n\r\n(06-23-07 - Updated to include topic specific Google search results: Linux, BSD, & microsoft)\r\n(03-08-08 - Updated to include the inexplicable addition of the \"http://www.l.google.com\" domain)\r\n(09-02-08 - Updated to a resolution of 1680x1050 and to reflect change in Google code)\r\n(09-10-08 - Updated code to improve improve implementation)","user":{"id":1340,"name":"USBman","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-09-10T21:53:35.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":791,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/2536-after.png?r=1587196895","url":"/styles/2536/bettersearch-preview-box-tweaks","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.google.com/search?\"),\r\n               url-prefix(http://www.l.google.com/search?),\r\n               url-prefix(http://www.google.com/linux?),\r\n               url-prefix(http://www.google.com/bsd?),\r\n               url-prefix(http://www.google.com/microsoft?) {\r\n\r\n/* UNindented listing */\r\n[class=\"r\"] > a + a + span  > a + a + a + [id^=\"BS_QP_\"] > [id$=\"_IF\"]\r\n{\r\nmargin:4px 0px 4px 0px !important;\r\nborder: 1px solid grey !important;\r\nwidth:1517px !important;\r\nheight:670px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* INDENTED listing */\r\n[style=\"margin-left: 3em;\"] > [class=\"r\"] > a + a + span  > a + a + a + [id^=\"BS_QP_\"] > [id$=\"_IF\"]\r\n{\r\nmargin:4px 0px 4px 0px !important;\r\nborder: 1px solid grey !important;\r\nwidth:1478px !important;\r\nheight:670px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* The width can be adjusted to whatever you'd like.
