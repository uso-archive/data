{"id":51095,"name":"Sidereel - Make New Episodes Ultra Easy To Spot!","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"sidereel","subcategory":"sidereel","style_tags":[],"description":"If you have a ton of shows listed on sidereel and want to easily spot new available episodes (while ignoring the 'you are up to date' shows) then this style is perfect for you. \r\n\r\nThis is in response to sidereel's latest css (summer 2011) that totally sucks. I mean, it looks nice and all, but it's useless. The show images are tiny and might as well not be there. The show title and boring info you already know are emphasized while the info you want, the info that should be the whole point of the site, is tiny and looks like an afterthought. I'm talking about the links and tracked episodes. They're tucked away under the show box. But enough of that rant. This will make your new episodes pop out. So useful when you track just about every show you've ever watched. :P\r\n\r\nIt does have a few extra tweaks so delete the section marked 'delete this' if you dislike them. :) :)","user":{"id":100879,"name":"mercave","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-08-12T14:35:24.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":198,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/51095_after.jpeg?r=1589097848","url":"/styles/51095/sidereel-make-new-episodes-ultra-easy-to-spot","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url(\"https://www.sidereel.com/users\") {\r\n\r\n/* Delete below this if you want */\r\n.show-image{border:0px !important;height:75px !important;position:relative !important;left:-10px;top:-5px;}\r\n.show-image a img{height:100% !important;margin-right:100px !important;}\r\n.show-name a {font-size:1.5em !important;}\r\n.tracker-controls a{font-size:1em !important;}\r\n/* Delete above this if you want */\r\n\r\n.blueprint-span-3 strong a{font-size:1.2em !important;color:#ffffff !important;}\r\n.blueprint-span-3{background:#00aadd !important;padding:10px !important;}\r\n.air-date{background:#00aadd !important;padding-top:10px !important;padding-bottom:10px !important;color:#ffffff !important;padding-left:3px !important;}\r\n.watch-toggle{padding-top:10px !important;padding-bottom:10px !important;color:#ffffff !important;}\r\n\r\n\r\n}"}
