Used alone, it'll look a little funny, and appear just for you.\r\n\r\nThis was created mostly for fun, but people who want to make it a serious part of their DubTrack theme can use it to do so. Chat ranks are aligned to the right, in pseudochildren, centered with the user avatar.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eBugs\u003c/b\u003e\r\nDue to how DubX handles creator rank (rather, how it \u003ci\u003edoesn't\u003c/i\u003e), all creators are also co-owners. This is only a minor inconvenience for theme maintainers, as you can allow specific users by default; Until that is fixed, replace .isCreator in line 49 (or about that) with the ID number of the room creator, or stuff that under user-specific settings.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eGitHub release\u003c/b\u003e\r\nIf you want the code straight away for addition into your community theme, then \u003ca href=https://hebgbs.github.io/bcranks.css\u003eget it here.\u003c/a\u003e It looks as intended when used with \u003ca href-https://hebgbs.github.io/betterchat.css\u003eBetter Chat\u003c/a\u003e, but can also be used alone.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"dubtrack.fm\") {\r\n\r\n/* Put chat objects above pseudochild */\r\n#chat LI P,\r\n#chat LI .username,\r\n#chat LI .image_row IMG{\r\n  position: relative !important;\r\n  z-index: 1 !Important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Pseudochild */\r\n#chat LI .stream-item-content:after{\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  z-index: 0;\r\n  font-family: proxima-nova,sans-serif;\r\n  font-size: 24pt;\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  color: rgb(255, 0, 255);\r\n  right: 32px;\r\n  top: 10px;\r\n  opacity: 0.3 !Important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Rank settings */\r\n#chat LI .isVip .stream-item-content:after{\r\n  content: \"VIP\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n#chat LI.isDj .stream-item-content:after{\r\n  content: \"DJ\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n#chat LI.isResident-dj .stream-item-content:after{\r\n  content: \"Resident DJ\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n#chat LI.isMod .stream-item-content:after{\r\n  content: \"Mod\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n#chat LI.isManager .stream-item-content:after{\r\n  content: \"Manager\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n#chat LI.isCo-owner .stream-item-content:after{\r\n  content: \"Co-owner\" /* Creators are also co-owners in DubX as of publishing. */\r\n}\r\n\r\n#chat LI.isCreator .stream-item-content:after{\r\n  content: \"Creator\" /* Doesn't exist in DubX as of publishing, might exist later. */\r\n                     /* Until then, For community styles use ID of creator instead. */\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* User-specific settings */\r\n#chat LI.current-chat-user .stream-item-content:after{\r\n  /* Placeholder.
