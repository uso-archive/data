I took screenshots of GLPI's demo page just to show it in use, but in practice I have changed the second line from \"glpi-project.org\" to my own local intranet site. To everyone who may find this style useful: change the domain from this sample one to your own domains, and it'll work like a charm for both of you.\r\n\r\nI will probably never update this file, but if I do I will post the newer versions on my GitHub over here: https://github.com/Linkz57/r-webwork/blob/master/userscripts/glpiBare.css","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"glpi-project.org\"){\r\n/*\tglpiBare.css v1.1 */\r\n  \r\ndiv#c_ssmenu1 {\r\n    display:none !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\ndiv#c_recherche {\r\n    display:none !important;\r\n  }  \r\n  \r\ndiv#c_preference {\r\n    display:none !important;\r\n  }  \r\n  \r\ndiv#c_menu {\r\n    display:none !important;\r\n  }\r\ndiv#c_logo {\r\n    display:none !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\ntd.tab_bg_2 {\r\n    display:none !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\na#global_entity_select {\r\n    display:none !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\nimg.hideme {\r\n    display:none !important;\r\n  }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/119132/glpibare.user.js","style_settings":[]}
