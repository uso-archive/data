If your screen is bigger and you would like me to resize any of the dash backgrounds, feel free to ask me at http://kazoos-rule.tumblr.com/ask I'll do it, no problem. \r\n\r\nThere's a link to the .gif I used to make the background so you can see it before downloading. It'd be much appreciated if you didn't steal any of my work. Thanks.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, that's pretty much it. I do take requests, so if you have anything in mind, feel free to let me know.
