{"id":127266,"name":"Facebook post interlude","description":"Every few posts (it's actually not a consistent number due to Facebook's complex HTML) this style inserts a big space and a box that says:\r\n\r\n...does this make sense right now?\r\n...is there something else that would be more exciting?\r\n\r\nNote that this doesn't just work in your newsfeed, but also on people's timelines and in groups. Anywhere where there are a bunch of posts in a row.\r\n\r\nI recommend having the habit of taking a deep breath when you see it, whether you decide to keep going or not.

You can change the text or the frequency by editing the CSS.\r\n\r\nFor the frequency, note that in theory \u003ccode\u003enth-child(3n)\u003c/code\u003e means \"show this after every third post\" but in practice facebook seems to clump some posts together, so that it's every... 5,8,5,10... ish posts apart, on the newsfeed, and 3,4,4,4 posts apart on my profile page. (I just sampled.)\r\n\r\nSo yeah, change it to \u003ccode\u003enth-child(2n)\u003c/code\u003e to have it show more densely, or to \u003ccode\u003enth-child(4n)\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003enth-child(5n)\u003c/code\u003e to show it less often. If you find yourself ignoring it because it shows up so much, you probably want it less often.\r\n\r\nUpdated 2016-07-19 because Facebook seems to have slightly new tags now. I also added one after the composer at the top, so you have a chance to pause before you've even started scrolling :)\r\n\r\nUpdated 2016-10-13: now works on mobile / m.facebook.com! I think that Firefox is the only mobile browser with userstyle support, so I recommend logging out of facebook on Chrome.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"www.facebook.com\") {\r\n._5pcb \u003e *:nth-child(3n):after,\r\n._5jmm:nth-child(3n):after,\r\n#pagelet_composer:after {\r\n\tcontent: \"...does this makes sense right now? \\0A\\0A ...is there something else that would be more exciting?\";\r\n    font-size: 16px;\r\n    font-family: 'Open Sans';\r\n    background: /*[[bgcolor]]*/;\r\n    color: /*[[fgcolor]]*/;\r\n    display: block;\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n    padding: 30px 5px;\r\n    margin: 240px 0 400px 1px;\r\n    white-space: pre;\r\n    box-shadow: 0px 3px 5px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4), 0px 5px 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.28), 0px 1px 14px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.24);\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"m.facebook.com\") {\r\n.storyStream:after,\r\n#mbasic_inline_feed_composer:after {\r\n\tcontent: \"...what's another thing you might like to do right now? \\0A\\0A ...would you rather do that than scroll through facebook?\";\r\n    font-size: 15px;\r\n    font-family: 'Open Sans';\r\n    background: /*[[bgcolor]]*/;\r\n    color: /*[[fgcolor]]*/;\r\n    display: block;\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n    padding: 60px 5px;\r\n    margin: 200px 0 300px 1px;\r\n    white-space: pre;\r\n    box-shadow: 0px 3px 5px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4), 0px 5px 8px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.28), 0px 1px 14px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.24);\r\n}\r\n\r\n#mbasic_inline_feed_composer:after {\r\n    margin-top: 600px;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/127266/facebook-post-interlude.user.js","style_settings":[{"id":451173,"style_id":127266,"install_key":"bgcolor","label":"Background Color","ordinal":0,"setting_type":"color","style_setting_options":[{"id":1626913,"style_setting_id":451173,"label":"placeholder","value":"#550022","default":true,"ordinal":0,"install_key":"placeholder"}]},{"id":451174,"style_id":127266,"install_key":"fgcolor","label":"Foreground Color","ordinal":1,"setting_type":"color","style_setting_options":[{"id":1626914,"style_setting_id":451174,"label":"placeholder","value":"#FFFFFF","default":true,"ordinal":0,"install_key":"placeholder"}]}]}
