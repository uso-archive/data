{"id":17132,"name":"ExpertsExchange","description":"You ever happened to urgently need a fast solution to a problem, search on Google, click a link - and again you were on a page of ExpertsExchange, exactly describing your problem - but not giving an answer? Instead they tell you, you *would* have found it here if you paid? Never again. Ads gone, solution shown :-)\r\n\r\nAnd as for the comment of Scriptuser below: I recommend to try it on more than one page before rating it 0. I use it in exactly that combination (Firefox 3 on Windows XP), and it works fine. Admitted, in some rare cases it fails (one out of 20 - meaning I didn't visit more than 20 pages yet, but it failed only once). If you encounter such a case, instead of rating 0 rather let me know so I can possibly do some thing about it.","user":{"id":12769,"name":"Izzy","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"updated":"2012-08-24T06:50:12.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":796,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/17132_after.jpeg?r=1675670412","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-04-20T05:55:30.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"experts-exchange","subcategory":"experts-exchange","additional_info":"It may not show all solutions, but make a lot of answers easier to spot by hiding all the \"junk\" around.
