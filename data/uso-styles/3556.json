I like to use the on line version because I can use the [Ctrl +] zoom feature of Firefox to adjust the font size, but sometimes, late at night, I find I need to zoom things too far and the things become unreadable.\r\n\r\nI should just toddle on off to bed. Instead, I just change the style a bit with Stylish and can stay up later (I mean read it easier).","user":{"id":4155,"name":"Charles Clarkson","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"cclarkson@htcomp.net","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2007-09-23T18:00:20.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":86,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3556_after.gif?r=1487981158","url":"/styles/3556/wider-dev-shed-newsletter","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.developershed.com\") {\r\n    table {\r\n        width: 90%;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n"}
