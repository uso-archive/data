{"id":3556,"name":"Wider Dev Shed Newsletter","description":"Developer Shed (http://www.developershed.com/) sends an informative weekly email newsletter (http://www.developershed.com/newsletter.php) out with a link to a copy (http://www.developershed.com/newsletter/archives/2007-09-20.html) on their web site.\r\n\r\nOutlook uses IE to display the newsletter and refuses to change the text font size. I like to use the on line version because I can use the [Ctrl +] zoom feature of Firefox to adjust the font size, but sometimes, late at night, I find I need to zoom things too far and the things become unreadable.\r\n\r\nI should just toddle on off to bed. Instead, I just change the style a bit with Stylish and can stay up later (I mean read it easier).","user":{"id":4155,"name":"Charles Clarkson","email":"cclarkson@htcomp.net","paypal_email":"cclarkson@htcomp.net","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-09-23T18:00:20.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":89,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3556_after.gif?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-09-23T18:00:20.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"developershed","subcategory":"developershed","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.developershed.com\") {\r\n    table {\r\n        width: 90%;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/3556/wider-dev-shed-newsletter.user.js","style_settings":[]}
