{"id":4047,"name":"Simpler Safari Books Online (O'Reilly)","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"oreilly","subcategory":"oreilly","style_tags":[],"description":"I was sick of all the crap surrounding books when reading them in HTML mode, so I whipped up a quick and dirty CSS script to remove all the distracting backgrounds and useless stuff (including the giant images on the homepage). I honestly don't know if it produces any rendering bugs other than the obvious (that a couple images may look odd since I didn't bother replacing them).\r\n\r\nAlso, I removed the navigation for O'Reilly, if you want that back, remove #headerNavigation > tbody > tr:first-child from the script.\r\n\r\nAnother darn problem I kept having was that the next-page links were too small and the pages felt hard to read from lack of white space. So I increased the size of the left and right bars, solving both problems in one go.","user":{"id":4761,"name":"Louis","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"LouisStAmour@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2007-11-07T22:55:46.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":300,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/4047_after.gif?r=1588320287","url":"/styles/4047/simpler-safari-books-online-o-reilly","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"safari.oreilly.com\") {\r\n#headerTable, #headerNavigation > tbody > tr:first-child, img[src$=\"contentbar_left.gif\"], img[src$=\"contentbar_right.gif\"], script + div > table.contenttable {\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\nbody * {\r\n\tbackground: #fff !important;\r\n\tcolor: #900 !important;\r\n}\r\n#SectionContent_Div {\r\n\tpadding: 5em !important;\r\n}\r\n#SectionContent_Div > * {\r\n\tmargin: 2em 0 !important;\r\n}\r\n#SectionContent_Div * {\r\n\tfont-family: Georgia, \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif !important;\r\n\tline-height: 1.4em !important;\r\n}\r\ntable[onmouseover$=\"setLeftBg('bookViewerOn')\"], table[onmouseover$='setRightBg(\"bookViewerOn\")'] {\r\n\twidth: 100px !important;\r\n\ttext-align: center !important;\r\n}\r\n.docText {\r\n\tcolor: #000 !important;\r\n}\r\na {\r\n\tcolor: #009 !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}
