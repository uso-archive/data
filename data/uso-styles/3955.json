{"id":3955,"name":"GMail NEW FORMAT Button Colors","description":"This is my \"work in progress\" toward coloring the GMail buttons now their site has changed.\r\nFOR NOW, all the buttons are green - I wanted black, but that screwed up the new Contacts Page Buttons.  I'm working on delineating the individual buttons but it's seemingly rather difficult and I won't have any more time tonight.  Rather a pain, and I've been on it 3 hours already.\r\n\r\nMy former script here\r\nhttp://userstyles.org/styles/291\r\n\r\nwas very popular, but it's not working as of 10/29/07 due to a site change.  GOOD News . . . GMail is much improved, bigger mailbox size, and larger contact photos and contact list controls.  Very cool!","user":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","paypal_email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-10-29T23:44:28.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1132,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3955_after.gif?r=1684656073","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-10-29T23:16:09.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*Coded by Paulfox October 29th, 2007, Version 3.2 as successor to my GMail Button Colors Script (site change @ Gmail)*/\r\n/*Original Script Coded by Paulfox April 20th 2006*/\r\n@-moz-document domain(mail.google.com) { \r\nBUTTON {color:black!important; font-weight:bold!important; background:lightgreen!important}}\r\n","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/3955/gmail-new-format-button-colors.user.js","style_settings":[]}
