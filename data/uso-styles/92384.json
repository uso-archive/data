No more ridiculous popup window! You can read the Artist Bio without having to squint your eyes within the insanely cumbersome white popup window!\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe FULL ARTIST BIO and ALBUM DESCRIPTION are now <strong>seamlessly scrollable</strong>. The font starts out smaller, and when you mouse-over the artist/album info the text size increases, and a vertical scrollbar appears when needed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI might add a feature to make it easier to change the font size, or to let you bring back the button (which still works, it just serves no purpose in my eyes). <i>All the CSS is already in there, with comments so it should already be REALLY easy to modify if you want to change anything.</i></p>\r\n<p>\r\nWritten with Love,<br>\r\nBlake</p>","user":{"id":170113,"name":"moistrous","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"moistrous@gmail.com","homepage":"http://moistrous.com","about":"<p>Enough about me!
