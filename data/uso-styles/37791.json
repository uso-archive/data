This seeks to correct that without making any extensive changes to the site layout or color scheme.\r\n\r\nThe appropriate text fields have been changed to black.\r\nThe appropriate unvisited links have been made a comparatively light blue (c0 in hex).\r\nThe appropriate visited links have been made a semi-off dark blue (1f red, 1f green, 80 blue all in hex).\r\n\r\nI hope other people feel that these changes make the site more bearable as much as I do.  As far as code sites go, they have the greatest library out of all of them.  Only one that even comes close is gshi.org, and gshi already has a wonderful scheme.","user":{"id":64338,"name":"LinuxDolt","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"slicersv@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-10-04T07:05:45.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":79,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/37791-after.png?r=1527768388","url":"/styles/37791/bsfree-better-bsfree","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"bsfree.org\") {\r\n\r\n.bgheading, .codedescalt\r\n{ color: #000000!important; }\r\n\r\n.bgheading A:link, .codedescalt A:link\r\n{ color: #0000c0!important; }\r\n\r\n.bgheading A:visited, .codedescalt A:visited\r\n{ color: #1f1f80!important; }\r\n\r\n}\r\n"}
