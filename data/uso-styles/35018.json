{"id":35018,"name":"Ultra Minimalist UI (old, for 3.0 and below)","description":"(This style has been updated for the latest version of Firefox. It's available here: style 59377)\r\n\r\nDrawing from several of the scripts available on this site, I created this style to strip down Firefox's UI to the bare minimum.\r\n\r\nThis style is meant for people who rely mainly on keyboard shortcuts and/or users of the FireGestures extension, who have no use for distracting buttons on the navigation, tab and scroll bars.\r\n\r\nI recommend installing the foxiFrame basic extension along with this style, to eliminate the title / caption bar and cut down on Firefox's UI still further. This style incorporates the codes for hiding the fullscreen, minimize, maximize and close buttons suggested in the foxiFrame options dialog.","user":{"id":44094,"name":"WandersFar","email":"wandersfar@yahoo.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2010-07-28T14:38:17.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":948,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/35018_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-07-28T14:38:17.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":"The screenshots were taken using the default theme in XP, Strata, with foxiFrame basic installed. I hide my menu, bookmarks, and status bars by default, so they are not visible in these screencaps -- anyway, this style does not affect any of those bars, just the navigation, tab and scroll bars.\r\n\r\nI've hidden all favicons in both the navigation and tab bars, but I've enabled throbbers in the tab bar to let you know when a page is still loading. If you prefer to remove these as well, delete the line beginning \".tabbrowser-tab[busy]\".\r\n\r\nFinally, check out the companion style, style 35019, to slim down your UI even more. When used together with this style, your navigation and tab bars' height is reduced by about a third, leaving you with more screen real estate.","style_tags":[],"css":"/*navigation*/\r\n#ff-close-button,\r\n#ff-fullscreen-button,\r\n#ff-maximize-button,\r\n#ff-minimize-button,\r\n#feed-button,\r\n#go-button,\r\n#star-button,\r\n#identity-box,\r\n.autocomplete-history-dropmarker\r\n      {display:none!important}\r\n\r\n/*scrollbars*/\r\nbody, \r\nbrowser[type=\"content-primary\"], \r\nbrowser[type=\"content-targetable\"]\r\n      {overflow-y:hidden!important; overflow-x:hidden!important}\r\n\r\n/*tabs*/\r\n.scrollbutton-up,\r\n.scrollbutton-down,\r\n.tab-close-button,\r\n.tabs-newtab-button,\r\n.tabs-container\u003estack,\r\n.tabbrowser-tab .tab-icon-image\r\n      {display:none!important}\r\n.tabbrowser-tab[busy] \u003e .tab-icon-image\r\n      {display:-moz-box!important}\r\n.tabbrowser-tab[label=\"(Untitled)\"]:not([blah]) label\r\n      {color:transparent!important; text-shadow:none!important}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
