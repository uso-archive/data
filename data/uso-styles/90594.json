It's not perfect, but it gets the job done. The only thing missing is the little nublet (arrow) that would normally appear underneath the icons, since I couldn't get it to line up properly. I think that's something we can live without. This is only tested on Chrome.","user":{"id":92489,"name":"riddler","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2013-07-15T16:05:07.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":749,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/90594_after.png?r=1587369869","url":"/styles/90594/facebook-navbar-fixed-chrome","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"#jewelContainer {\r\n  float: left;\r\n  position: relative; right: 655px; }\r\n\r\ndiv._585- {\r\n  float: left; \r\nposition: relative;\r\nright: -160px;\r\nwidth: 550px; }\r\n\r\n._5bfg #jewelContainer .jewelFlyout {\r\n  left: -150px; }\r\n\r\n._5bfg #jewelContainer .jewelFlyout .beeperNub {\r\ntop: -100px;}\r\n\r\nhtml #pageLogo._5bfh a {\r\n\r\n    background-image: url(\"http://i.imgur.com/kUOw5Vt.png\") !important;\r\n\r\n    background-repeat: no-repeat !important;\r\n\r\n    background-size: auto auto !important;\r\n\r\n    background-position: -6px 5px !important;\r\n\r\n    height: 29px !important;\r\n\r\n    padding: 0px !important;\r\n\r\n    position: relative !important;\r\n\r\n    width: 104px !important;\r\n\r\n    z-index: 2 !important; }\r\n"}
