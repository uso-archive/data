That's because all of the notes you would have seen were without commentary.\r\n\r\nv5 (2017/06/21): Noticed that at some point likes started showing up in the feed view again. Simple fix.\r\nv4 (2014/12/07): The user style broke again at some point. I've simplified it to just use !important instead of actually having to figure out how to fix it every time Tumblr changes their layout.\r\nv3 (2013/08/24): Edited to compensate for dashboard changes since I released v2.\r\nv2: Turns out replies also count as \"without commentary\" (Which is really, really dumb, but whatever). I made an exception for it.\r\nv1: Initial release.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"tumblr.com\") {\r\n.without_commentary:not(.source_post):not(.reply):not(.posted) {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.without-commentary:not(.source_post):not(.reply):not(.posted) {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/85877/tumblr-hide-notes-without-commentary.user.js","style_settings":[]}
