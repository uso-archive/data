  "description": "This style adds the echo value of the options on the Faction Conflict Cards. It also adds what will be gained that can't be expressed in echos: menace changes, second chances, bundles, etc.\r\n\r\nIt also adds the echo value for all the Call in favours storylets, even though they are all the same.\r\n\r\nFinally, it also adds a reminder to card options that give a favour when this is not communicated via the text on the card (like the The Heron Tower card).\r\n\r\nThis style works with the June 2018 redesign.",
