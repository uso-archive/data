{"id":160993,"name":"Fallen London - ConflictCard Echos \u0026 Hidden Favour","description":"This style adds the echo value of the options on the Faction Conflict Cards. It also adds what will be gained that can't be expressed in echos: menace changes, second chances, bundles, etc.\r\n\r\nIt also adds the echo value for all the Call in favours storylets, even though they are all the same.\r\n\r\nFinally, it also adds a reminder to card options that give a favour when this is not communicated via the text on the card (like the The Heron Tower card).\r\n\r\nThis style works with the June 2018 redesign.","user":{"id":17532,"name":"Corran","email":"db@dbbv.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"updated":"2019-08-16T18:11:16.000Z","weekly_install_count":4,"total_install_count":750,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/160993_after.jpeg?r=1687593692","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2018-06-06T06:09:12.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"fallenlondon","subcategory":"fallenlondon","additional_info":"2019-08-16: updated with the new Lord Mayor favours.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"fallenlondon.com\") {\r\n\r\n/* Shows Echo value for conflict cards and call in favours storylets and card */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"4802\"] h2::after {content: \" [ 4.2E ]\";} /* Call in favours in the Forgotten Quarter - The dead men's chest */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"4803\"] h2::after {content: \" [ 4.2E ]\";} /* Call in favours in the Forgotten Quarter - A curious knot */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"4804\"] h2::after {content: \" [ 4.2E ]\";} /* Call in favours in the Forgotten Quarter - A soothing sight */\r\n\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"4808\"] h2::after {content: \" [ 9E ]\";} /* Call in favours in the Flit - Trade favours with criminals */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"4809\"] h2::after {content: \" [ 28.8E ]\";} /* Call in favours in the Flit - Trade favours with revolutionaries */\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"4810\"] h2::after {content: \" [ 25 Scrap, Bundle (1-230) ]\";} /* Call in favours in the Flit - Trade favours with urchins */\r\n\r\ndiv[data-branch-id=\"5960\"] h2::after {content: \" [ -2 Suspicion, 6E ]\";} /* Crime or punishment?
