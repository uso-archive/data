{"id":37774,"name":"Kill Helvetica","description":"Many Windows users of Firefox, including myself, suffer from strange Helvetica font issues. Firefox does not appear to render the font correctly and makes sites which use the font (e.g. Digg, Twitter, etc.) very difficult to read. \r\n\r\nThis style simply overrides Helvetica Neue and tells Firefox to use the local Arial font instead.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.keyvan.net/2010/10/helvetica-on-firefox/ for more information.\r\n\r\nThis problem has been reported in various places:\r\n\r\nhttps://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions/750824\r\nhttps://support.mozilla.com/hi-IN/questions/744520\r\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578829\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nApologies for the deceptive ads you see on this page, I have no control over that.
