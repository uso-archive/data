After noticing that many of the sites I use regularly didn't have any dark styles (or any styles at all for that matter), I decided to upload my own for any other sufferers (or just anyone else who likes a darker look) to use. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am in no way an expert. I am aware that most of my styles are far from perfect, but they work for what I use them for. I learned a lot of what I know from just looking at other people's styles I've used in the past; as such, everyone is welcome to make whatever changes are needed to my styles to suit their own usage/tastes (if you need help, just ask).\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has contributed to this great utility, and eternal thanks to Stylish for being exactly what lets me enjoy the web!\r\n\r\nPS. I use the FT DeepDark theme and styles for Firefox by Steva/Sr21, so my dark color scheme is similar to that (although I make mine a touch darker). If you want different colors, everything should be easily changeable.","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2016-08-09T16:08:45.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":122,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/104786-after.png?r=1685520013","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2014-08-29T04:20:11.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"blogspot","subcategory":"blogspot","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"go-dutch-with-roodvosje.blogspot.com\"), domain(\"go-dutch-with-roodvosje.blogspot.ca\") {\r\n\r\nhtml, body, footer \r\n{color: white !important;\r\nbackground: #111 !important;}\r\n\r\n.column-center-outer, .column-right-outer, .region-inner, .column-right-inner\r\n{color: white !important;\r\nbackground: #222 !important;}\r\n\r\ntbody, thead, th, tr, td, blockquote, li, ul, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, form, #header, .post-body span, .widget-content span\r\n{color: white !important;}\r\n\r\n.post-body a span, .widget-content a span\r\n{color: #00adee !important;}\r\n\r\nfooter\r\n{display: none}\r\n\r\na\r\n{color: #00adee !important;}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/104786/go-dutch-dark-nova.user.js","style_settings":[]}
