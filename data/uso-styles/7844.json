(Fx3 And Fx2)\r\n- Bolding is optional, and has been commented out of the code, Remove the comments and bold the menus.k\r\n\r\nCode Colors Provided:\r\n- Color of menus by default for this theme will be White (easy to change)\r\n- Bold text will be Disabled\r\n- Yes, screenshot shows red, but it looked bad on white (thats why it is Customizable!)\r\n\r\nApplies to:\r\n- File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Tools and Help menus\r\n- Navigation Toolbar (example: right clicking on back button)\r\n- Main Context Menu (Right clicking on any web page)\r\n- Right-Clicking on a tab\r\n- Right-Clicking on the Location Bar (address bar)\r\n- Also Applies to EVERY single menu on any window of a popup or pane\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n- Works on Firefox 2\r\n- Works on Firefox 3\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n- Make sure you don't use a menu-color that conflicts with your themes.
