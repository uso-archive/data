{"id":290,"name":"Image Search Results Black Background Multi Site","description":"Originally to make page background black on viewing Google Images,  now includes others, all for which I have a \"search all these\" CustomButtons button.  Less eye strain and \"white noise;\" images stand out better, AllTheWeb and Google Logos removed.  Font \"grey\" - easier to read on some sites.  Back out sites you don't need or want.  If all you need is Google Images, change grey to \"white.\" \r\n\r\nUpdate now includes :  Google Images, Allthe web, Ask.com images and pics, dogpile, flickr, msn live search, photobucket, picsearch, searchcom and webcrawler (not all fit into the generic \"formula\" and were amended to their own \"settings\").  If any of them give you problems just remove them; I like these settings \"for me.\"  \r\n\r\nAdded on Jan 25th 2007 :  separate rule now for Google Images which now requires \"dataimage, divimage and divsnippet\" to handle the new \"mouseover popups\" on Google Images.  The others in the string don't require the Google additions, so I separated Google on \"its own.\"","user":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","paypal_email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-01-25T19:14:13.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":2007,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/290_after.png?r=1686643213","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-04-26T15:43:04.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*Coded by Paulfox April 19th 2006, Updated 1/25/07 Ver 2.3 to GoogleImages+Mouseover(s) grey font*/\r\n/*IMG Search Blk BG*/\r\n@-moz-document domain(images.google.com) {body,[id*=\"tDataImage\"],[id*=\"div_hidden\"],[id*=\"div_image\"],[id*=\"div_snippet\"] {background:#000000!important} a,font {color:grey!important}}\r\n@-moz-document domain(flickr.com),domain(images.search.yahoo.com),url-prefix(http://www.alltheweb.com/search?cat=img),url-prefix(http://www.dogpile.com/info.dogpl/search/images/),url-prefix(http://www.google.com/images),url-prefix(http://images.ask.com/pictures),url-prefix(http://pictures.ask.com/),url-prefix(http://msxml.webcrawler.com/info.wbcrwl/search/images),url-prefix(http://www.search.com/images) {\r\nbody {background:#000000!important}\r\na,font {color:grey!important} [src*=\"atwlogo.gif\"],[src*=\"/images/images_res.gif\"] {display:none!important}}\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http://www.altavista.com/image/) {body,tr[class=\"resultGroup\"] {background:#000000!important}}\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http://photobucket.com/images/) {body,#containerContent {background:#000000!important}}\r\n@-moz-document domain(search.live.com) {div[class=\"twg_headerhtml\"] {display:none!important}\r\n#results_control,#root,[id=\"scroll_panel\"] {background:#000000!important}\r\np {color:grey!important}}\r\n@-moz-document domain(picsearch.com) {body,[class=\"w\"],[class=\"yl\"] {background:#000000!important}}","discussions":[{"id":3767,"name":"Thank you.
