{"id":70710,"name":"Global: Black on White - CRT Terminal/TTY Text","description":"This is a global style, that means that it is not perfect since you cant predict the coding style of every CSS developer on the planet. My goal was to keep this style dependency free -- and not to need tweaks for specific sites. This is as close as it gets, scroll thru screenshots for examples.","user":{"id":87204,"name":"osirisgothra","email":"osirisgothra@hotmail.com","paypal_email":"osirisgothra@hotmail.com","homepage":"http://www.github.com/osirisgothra","about":"Gabriel Sharp\r\n\r\nI consider myself a lifetime student of Computer Sciences and Information Sciences, as the time for learning is never over, especially when working in a field that deals with envelopes that are ever-changing, pushing endlessly, so to speak. My work and play cross paths often since I get a lot of joy out of what I do and study, some of which are:\r\n\r\n- Perl + CPAN Developer\r\n- Linux C++ Developer (Qt4, Qt5, KDE4, KFM5, and related)\r\n- Shell Script Developer (Perl, BASH, sh, upstart, vim plugin development)\r\n- Web Style Developer (CSS, SaSS, SGML, HTML5, etc) though I do know HTML4 too [who doesn't?]\r\n- Windows C++ Developer (Old Pro in Microsoft related technologies)\r\n- Old-School Technologies (qbasic, vbdos, borland c++, ms-dos 6.66, i386 assembler /w emphasis on _some_ 64-bit stuff)\r\n- Music Hobbyist (Electronic Music Writer, Piano, Keyboard player/Enthusiast)\r\n- Graphic Artist (Pencil/Pen/Watercolor physical media, Maya/Blender/3DSMax/Bryce/Gimp/Photoshop HD and post-production)\r\n\r\nI am not currently in any group at the time. I am not sure if I will be doing that ever again. The last few groups I participated in were too incoherent and seemed to have different ideals, ethics, goals. \r\n\r\nI am open to suggestion or requests, just don't make them impossible for a single person to do. Requesting a theme have a black version is probably okay. Requesting that I personally show up and restyle your entire website is probably not. Of course, if I were getting paid to do it, that would be a whole other matter, but I rarely see people paying for such things these days when you can hire someone in another country to do it for 2 cents -- that's right I'm a bitter man :D= \u003c- those are vampire teeth!!","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2012-08-05T02:29:17.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":2247,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/70710_after.png?r=1687075281","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/70710_additional_4188.gif?r=1687075281","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/70710_additional_4189.png?r=1687075281","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/70710_additional_4190.gif?r=1687075281","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/70710_additional_4191.gif?r=1687075281","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/70710_additional_4192.gif?r=1687075281"],"license":null,"created":"2012-08-05T02:29:17.000Z","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"additional_info":"Requires:\r\nCSS2 (CSS3 for best look)\r\nStylish (for automated setup of overriding style) and Compat.
