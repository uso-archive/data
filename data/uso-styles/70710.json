My goal was to keep this style dependency free -- and not to need tweaks for specific sites. This is as close as it gets, scroll thru screenshots for examples.","user":{"id":87204,"name":"osirisgothra","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"osirisgothra@hotmail.com","homepage":"http://www.github.com/osirisgothra","about":"Gabriel Sharp\r\n\r\nI consider myself a lifetime student of Computer Sciences and Information Sciences, as the time for learning is never over, especially when working in a field that deals with envelopes that are ever-changing, pushing endlessly, so to speak. My work and play cross paths often since I get a lot of joy out of what I do and study, some of which are:\r\n\r\n- Perl + CPAN Developer\r\n- Linux C++ Developer (Qt4, Qt5, KDE4, KFM5, and related)\r\n- Shell Script Developer (Perl, BASH, sh, upstart, vim plugin development)\r\n- Web Style Developer (CSS, SaSS, SGML, HTML5, etc) though I do know HTML4 too [who doesn't?]\r\n- Windows C++ Developer (Old Pro in Microsoft related technologies)\r\n- Old-School Technologies (qbasic, vbdos, borland c++, ms-dos 6.66, i386 assembler /w emphasis on _some_ 64-bit stuff)\r\n- Music Hobbyist (Electronic Music Writer, Piano, Keyboard player/Enthusiast)\r\n- Graphic Artist (Pencil/Pen/Watercolor physical media, Maya/Blender/3DSMax/Bryce/Gimp/Photoshop HD and post-production)\r\n\r\nI am not currently in any group at the time. I am not sure if I will be doing that ever again. The last few groups I participated in were too incoherent and seemed to have different ideals, ethics, goals. \r\n\r\nI am open to suggestion or requests, just don't make them impossible for a single person to do. Requesting a theme have a black version is probably okay. Requesting that I personally show up and restyle your entire website is probably not. Of course, if I were getting paid to do it, that would be a whole other matter, but I rarely see people paying for such things these days when you can hire someone in another country to do it for 2 cents -- that's right I'm a bitter man :D= <- those are vampire teeth!!","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2012-08-05T02:29:17.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":2128,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/70710_after.png?r=1597046809","url":"/styles/70710/global-black-on-white-crt-terminal-tty-text","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/*\r\nGlobal Black On White v1.0-1  by Gabriel Sharp(osirisgothra@hotmail.com)\r\nhttp://paradisim.uuuq.com\r\nhttp://userstyles.org/users/87204\r\n*/\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://\")\r\n{\r\n\r\nBODY \r\n{\r\nbackground-color: black !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nBODY *, body form *\r\n{\r\nbackground-color: transparent !important;\r\ntext-overflow: hidden !important;\r\ncolor: #999 !important;\r\nborder-radius: 4px !important;\r\nborder-color: transparent !important;\r\n-moz-appearance: none !important;\r\nbackground-image: none !important;\r\nfont-family: \"Terminal\" !important;\r\nfont-size: 9pt !important;\r\nfont-weight: 400 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nimg:hover\r\n{\r\nbackground-color: transparent !important;\r\nopacity: 1.0 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh1,h2,h3,h4,h5\r\n{\r\nbackground-color: transparent !important;\r\ntext-decoration: underline !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh5,h4\r\n{\r\nbackground-color: transparent !important;\r\ncolor: #aaa !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh3\r\n{\r\nbackground-color: transparent !important;\r\ncolor: #ccc !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh2\r\n{\r\ncolor: #ddd !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh1\r\n{\r\ncolor: white !important;\r\nfont-weight: bold !important;\r\ntext-decoration: none !important;\r\nbackground-color: transparent !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\na\r\n{\r\ntext-decoration: none !important;\r\ncolor: white !important;\r\nbackground-color: transparent !important;\r\nborder-width: 0px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\na:hover\r\n{\r\nborder-width: 1px !important;\r\nborder-radius: 4px !important;\r\ncolor: black !important;\r\ntext-shadow: #444 0 0 1px !important;\r\n}\r\na:visited\r\n{\r\nbackground-color: transparent !important;\r\ncolor: #FFD9FF !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nform *\r\n{\r\nbackground-color: transparent !important;\r\ncolor: white !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nform>div>button\r\n{\r\nbackground-color: #222 !important;\r\ncolor: red !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimg, img *, body>div>div>a\r\n{\r\nopacity: 0.50 !important;\r\nborder-radius: 4px !important;\r\nmargin: 6px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
