I don't know if that's just me but the original borders are looking kinda thin on a side and thicker on the other side along with a weird color tone to them. So I decided to change that and make them look appealing.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"steamcommunity.com\") {\r\n\r\n.playerAvatar.online {\r\n    background: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, #53A4C4 0, #458097 100%);\r\n    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #53A4C4 0, #458097 100%);\r\n}\r\n.playerAvatar.in-game {\r\n    background: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, #8FB93B 0, #6E8C31 100%);\r\n    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #8FB93B 0, #6E8C31 100%);\r\n}\r\n.playerAvatar.offline {\r\n    background: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, #959595 0, #333 100%);\r\n    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #959595 0, #333 100%);\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*Improved borders for avatars*/\r\n.playerAvatar {\r\n    padding: 3px !important;\r\n    border-radius: 2px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*Fixes borders for profile avatar*/\r\n.profile_header .playerAvatarAutoSizeInner {\r\n    margin: 3px !important;\r\n    border-radius: 2px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*Re-align the profile summary a little bit.*/\r\n.profile_header .playerAvatar.profile_header_size {\r\n    margin-right: 14px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/160308/steam-better-avatar-borders.user.js","style_settings":[]}
