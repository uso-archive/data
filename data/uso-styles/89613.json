Added the Security site.\r\n\r\nNovember 4, 2016: Programmers site now renamed to Software Engineering.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 2016: The Programmers exchange site apparently changed names behind the scenes to Software Engineering (lol).  Updated that favicon URL.  Also changed to domain regex to match more top-level domains (.ca, .co.uk, etc).\r\n\r\nApril 3, 2016: Stack Exchange favicons were moved to a \"Sites\" subdirectory. Also changed icons to use HTTPS since Google results are secure default now.\r\n\r\nDec 22, 2015: Stack Exchange favicons got updated to 32x32 versions. Adjusted style to resize these back down to near 16x16, but they are less consistent now and some are sized differently or are nudged left or right.\r\n\r\nJul 23, 2015: Google changed results from \u0026lt;li\u003e to \u0026lt;div\u003e elements (which is weird, since they're still in a parent \u0026lt;ol\u003e...).\r\n\r\nAug 8, 2013: Added styles for a few other Stack Exchange sites besides Stack Overflow.  For more comprehensive coverage a user script would work better, but I like the lower overhead of a user style.\r\n\r\nKeywords: stack exchange stack overflow stackoverflow server fault favicon google","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document regexp(\".*www\\\\.google(\\\\.[a-z]{1,4}){1,2}\\\\/search.*\") {\r\n\r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"http://stackoverflow.com\"],\r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"https://stackoverflow.com\"] {\r\n        padding-left: 20px !important;\r\n        background: url(https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/favicon.ico) no-repeat -2px 0 / 20px 20px !important;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com\"],\r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com\"] {\r\n        padding-left: 20px !important;\r\n        background: url(https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/softwareengineering/img/favicon.ico) no-repeat 0 0 / 16px 16px !important;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"http://programmers.stackexchange.com\"],\r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"https://programmers.stackexchange.com\"] {\r\n        padding-left: 20px !important;\r\n        background: url(https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/softwareengineering/img/favicon.ico) no-repeat 0 0 / 16px 16px !important;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"http://security.stackexchange.com\"],\r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"https://security.stackexchange.com\"] {\r\n        padding-left: 20px !important;\r\n        background: url(https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/security/img/favicon.ico) no-repeat 0 0 / 16px 16px !important;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"http://dba.stackexchange.com\"],\r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"https://dba.stackexchange.com\"] {\r\n        padding-left: 20px !important;\r\n        background: url(https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/dba/img/favicon.ico) no-repeat 0 0 / 16px 16px !important;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"http://serverfault.com\"],\r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"https://serverfault.com\"] {\r\n        padding-left: 20px !important;\r\n        background: url(https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/serverfault/img/favicon.ico) no-repeat 1px 0 / 15px 15px !important;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"http://superuser.com\"], \r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"https://superuser.com\"] {\r\n        padding-left: 20px !important;\r\n        background: url(https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/superuser/img/favicon.ico) no-repeat 2px 0 / 16px 16px !important;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"http://codereview.stackexchange.com\"],\r\n    #search .g .rc .r a[href^=\"https://codereview.stackexchange.com\"] {\r\n        padding-left: 20px !important;\r\n        background: url(https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/codereview/img/favicon.ico) no-repeat 0 0 / 16px 16px !important;\r\n    }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/89613/stack-exchange-icons-in-google-results.user.js","style_settings":[]}
