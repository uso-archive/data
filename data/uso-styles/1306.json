{"id":1306,"name":"Yahoo Blaster ScrapYard","description":"This is a \"throwout\" of elements to help some or all of you with Yahoo.  Don't bother rating it, as it's 1) merely a compilation of blockers I used to clean up Yahoo Mail for my ex girlfriend (avid Yahoo fan), and Yahoo Search and 2) used only on \"old Yahoo Mail, not the beta.  I dumped Yahoo in favor of Gmail/Google long ago, but pick and choose which of these elements of these you might be able to use.  Be aware it AGGRESSIVELY strips Yahoo Mail and makes it actually readable/useable, but I can't vouch for how gentle it may be to \"My Yahoo\" or other links you might use!   \r\n\r\nI never included these in FiltersetP, as frankly it was a lot of \"real estate\" for one site.  That's why this is not called an \"Ad Blocking FiltersetP add-on.\" Yahoo is the hardest site of all to effectively clean up in my opinion - this goes a long way toward doing that.  I remember simple \"2 term\" filters suggested by other filtersets caused stacks of false positives, so I set about definitively cleaning it up as carefully as possible.  Rick's Easy List (elements) has some GREAT ideas as well, so check that one out and mix/match/compare the two and you'll be in good shape.   HOWEVER . . . .\r\n\r\nIncreasingly, some sites (!!) are incorporating valid site elements within parameters of advertising elements, so blocking ads sacrifices content!  If you lose items you need to see, disable this Stylish script and use the DOMi to find the element you're being denied - simply delete that from the listing.","user":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","paypal_email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2006-11-10T01:34:14.000Z","weekly_install_count":2,"total_install_count":5085,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/1306-after.png?r=1687507280","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-11-10T01:33:02.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"yahoo","subcategory":"yahoo","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n/*Coded by Paulfox over last 16 months through November 10th, 2006, released Nov 10th 06, Version 1.1*/\r\n/*YH*/\r\n@-moz-document domain(yahoo.com) {\r\n#bd,#defaultsearch,#ftnav,#H4,#lrec,#nwad,#tour,#ymv1,#yss,#yredmods,#yregtxt,#yregad,#yregbnr,#yregft,\r\n#yregintl,#yreglocntnt,#yregpromo,#yregschbox, #yregwhatsnew, #yrgprops, #yschanswr, #yschsec,[class=\"yschbbox\"],\r\n#yshp_east_ads,.yshp_ad_header,div.content,div.lrec,div.ovt,div[class=\"modulecontainer topfilled\"],#firsttd+td,#leftnavad,#maincontentad,#northbanner,\r\nfont[size=\"-2\"][face=\"arial\"],#spaceidframe,#swads,#Tableau_01,body\u003etable\u003etbody\u003etr\u003etd\u003etable\u003etbody\u003etr \u003etd \u003ecenter \u003etable\u003etbody\u003etr\u003etd\u003efont,\r\ntable[width=\"300\"] {display:none!important}}\r\n\r\n/*YH News/Search Bar*/\r\n@-moz-document domain(news.yahoo.com) {.providers,.alerts,.rss {display:none!important}}\r\n@-moz-document url(yahoo.com) {#h,div#ss,div#v,div#wm {display:none!important}}","discussions":[{"id":8029,"name":"Oh man this is exactly what I was looking for to g","rating":3,"created":"2008-03-31T18:01:42.000Z","author_name":"tsunami643","author_id":7232},{"id":12605,"name":"Too much lose of content.","rating":1,"created":"2009-06-26T14:39:53.000Z","author_name":"litemninyuszika","author_id":25213}],"discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/1306/yahoo-blaster-scrapyard.user.js","style_settings":[]}
