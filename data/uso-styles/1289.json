{"id":1289,"name":"LuminousLandscape (fix black bkgd & white font)","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"luminous-landscape","subcategory":"luminous-landscape","style_tags":[],"description":"Black background and white font may seem cool?!?  But if you try to read a site for any length of time that is set up this way, you are looking for a case of EYESTRAIN!!  DOH!!  So, if you're actually there to read what is written on the site, a light grey bkgd with black font will get you going.  \r\n\r\nIt's funny, hah, that photo sites and innovative programming sites are often the worst offenders.  Luminouslandscape.com, naturfotograf.com and even harrysproshop are pretty decent sites, especially naturfotograf -- good info and pics -- but they suffer from 'look too cool disease'.  \r\n\r\nI'm no expert in @-mox-document , css , or web design, so I'm sure that this could be improved.  (For instance, on luminouslandscape.com, there's a virtual rainbow of <font color=\"dramatic\">'s that could mabe be set to all one (interesting) value??  That might just cure a minor irritant; meanwhile that site will now be readable already.)\r\n\r\nIt should be obvious and trivial to add or replace web-sites by simply adjusting the header info in the script.  \r\n\r\nOldUncleMe","user":{"id":1055,"name":"OldUncleMe","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2006-11-07T08:52:40.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":323,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/1289-after.png?r=1589443410","url":"/styles/1289/luminouslandscape-fix-black-bkgd-white-font","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url(\"http://luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/olympus-e1.shtml\"),\r\n               url-prefix(\"http://luminous-landscape.com/*\"),\r\n               url-prefix(\"http://naturfotograf.com/*\"),\r\n               url-prefix(\"http://harrysproshop.com/*\"),\r\n               domain(\"luminous-landscape.com\"),\r\n               domain(\"naturfotograf.com\"),\r\n               domain(\"harrysproshop.com\") {\r\n\r\n/* *** doesn't work without  !important *** */\r\n/* ***        USE:   !important         *** */\r\n\r\nbody, p, h6, h1, em, h, table, tr, td{\r\n  background: #888 !important;\r\n  background-color: #aaa !important;\r\n  color: black !important;\r\n    }\r\np      {\r\n  color: black !important;\r\n  }\r\na:link {\r\n  color:#358 !important;\r\n  text-decoration:none !important;\r\n  font-weight: bold !important;\r\n  }\r\na:visited {\r\n  color:#525 !important;\r\n  text-decoration:none !important;\r\n  font-weight: bold !important;\r\n  }\r\na:hover {\r\n  color:#385 !important;\r\n  text-decoration:underline !important;\r\n  font-weight: bold !important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n"}
