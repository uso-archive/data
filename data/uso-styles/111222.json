This is to see the clothes on your character. To wear real clothes, you have to find or buy them and be in the appropriate guard.\r\n\r\nIn order to use, you must wear:\r\n- Original Eldarya pink dress (free)\r\n\r\nNOTE: This means the outfit will be on one layer only (the dress layer). You cannot move the individual pieces onto separate layers. Sorry. ^__^;\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent styles for guards:\r\nAbsynthe: Complete!\r\n\r\nObsidienne: Complete!\r\n\r\nOmbre (Shadow): I am missing the entire top half.
