{"id":641,"name":"New Y! Stock board font fix","description":"This is a font-fix for the new Y! stock message boards.  It uses your default sans-serif font at (hopefully) normal size.  As the new CSS has a font-size: and font-family: declaration for damn-near every tag in the stylesheet, and each tag is deeply nested, it's way too much work to make the browser use your default styles, so if this doesn't do what you need, you may have to tweak it.","user":{"id":345,"name":"Karl","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2006-07-15T09:19:57.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":544,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/641-after.png?r=1683187213","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-07-15T09:19:57.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"yahoo","subcategory":"yahoo","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"messages.finance.yahoo.com\") {\r\n\r\n  body { \r\n    font-size: 120%!important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .user-data, .user-href, .user-href a {\r\n    font-family: sans-serif!important;\r\n    font-size: 120%!important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/641/new-y-stock-board-font-fix.user.js","style_settings":[]}
