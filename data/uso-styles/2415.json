{"id":2415,"name":"Neopets.com - Smaller Font [New Site Design]","description":"If you're like me, you cannot stand the default font family and sizes displayed on the website or the size / font of the buttons and form fields.

I was quite annoyed when they enlarged all the drop-down menu's, text field's and button's fonts.\r\n\r\nThis changes the entire site's (including petpages, user lookups, guilds, shops, etc.) to Tahoma 8pt.\r\nIt can easily be turned on/off, but since this just edits font, it shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nClick and drag the screenshots to your address bar for a full view.\r\n\r\nIf there's anything I've missed or you feel should be added, let me know. ^^","user":{"id":2723,"name":"Fuzio","email":"fuzio@roadrunner.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-05-26T15:01:35.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1012,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/2415_after.png?r=1685606419","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-05-26T12:56:59.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"neopets","subcategory":"neopets","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"neopets.com\") {\r\n/* This changes the entire page's font */\r\n        body, td {\r\n\t        font: 8pt Tahoma !important;\r\n}\r\n/* This changes the NST Clock */\r\n\t#nst {\r\n\t\tfont: 8pt Tahoma !important;\r\n}\r\n/* This changes the username of your NeoFriends on the NeoFriend Module on the sidebar */\r\n        .neofriendUsername {\r\n                font: 7.5pt Tahoma !important;\r\n}\r\n/* This changes your pets info (stats, gender, etc.) on the sidebar module */\r\n        .activePetInfo, .activePetInfo TD {\r\n                font: 7pt Tahoma !important;\r\n}\r\n/* This changes all of the drop-down menus, text fields, and buttons on the site */\r\n        input, textarea, form, select {\r\n                font: 8pt Tahoma !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":6444,"name":"wow I like this one a lot (: it's VERY helpful for","rating":3,"created":"2009-05-03T01:44:56.000Z","author_name":"foxehh","author_id":23097}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/2415/neopets-com-smaller-font-new-site-design.user.js","style_settings":[]}
