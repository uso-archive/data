{"id":233103,"name":"Bigger photo slideshow (Zillow)","description":"Zillow is great, but the photos are so tiny! This zooms in on them. So you can see them bigger. The photos themselves are not bigger. They don't want to show you full-resolution photos. Find the listing realtor website for that, but they probably will show small photos too, to keep it mysterious and hide imperfections. But at least now you don't have to squint and get real close to the screen. Much bigger photos now.","user":{"id":1324680,"name":"Paul Shorey","email":"web@artspaces.net","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2022-03-15T15:54:22.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":8,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/233103_additional_40179.png?r=1686816016","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/233103_additional_40179.png?r=1686816016"],"license":"publicdomain","created":"2022-03-15T15:54:22.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"zillow","subcategory":"zillow","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://www.zillow.com/homedetails\") {\r\n.hdp-gallery-image {\r\n\twidth:100% !important;\r\n    height:100% !important;\r\n    max-width: 1200px !important;\r\n}\r\n.hdp-gallery-image \u003e div {\r\n    width:100% !important;\r\n}\r\n.hdp-gallery-image picture,\r\n.hdp-gallery-image img {\r\n\twidth:100% !important;\r\n    height:auto !important;\r\n    max-height: 1000000px !important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/233103/bigger-photo-slideshow-zillow.user.js","style_settings":[]}
