  "description": "Here's a userstyle to turn the Homestuck Epilogue text into comic sans.  Simply put, I made it because comic sans is very easy to read and the epilogue is text heavy so using this makes it easier to actually process all those words on one page like that.",

I just personally prefer comic sans for my own access needs :)\r\n\r\nAs comic sans is classed as a cursive font, this userstyle may render badly for users without comic sans installed.  I don't have a solution for that besides advising to either install it or change it to another preferred font.",
