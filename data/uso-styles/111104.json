If important parts of the theme are missing and do not appear as you believe they should from the screenshots, please contact me and I will try to resolve it.","license":"ccby"},"updated":"2015-03-03T12:50:39.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":112,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/111104_after.png?r=1687075281","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"ccby","created":"2015-03-03T12:50:39.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"wtfismyip","subcategory":"wtfismyip","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"wtfismyip.com\") {\r\n  \r\n  body {\r\n    background-color: #002b36;\r\n    color: #839496;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  a:link, a:visited, #tor {\r\n    color: #cb4b16;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  #sidebar h2 {\r\n    color: #93a1a1;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":66734,"name":"Nice!
