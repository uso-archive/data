I can't stand  light gray fonts. They are hard to read. Unfortunately we live in a world where web designers are mostly in their 20s and all have perfect vision and the latest hardware. They design for themselves and not for the users. \r\n\r\nMy simple styles are about making things just a little more readable. Nothing fancy, just simple legibility.","license":"ccbysa"},"updated":"2014-10-02T20:53:03.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":195,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/105932_after.jpeg?r=1681459215","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2014-10-02T20:29:44.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"chefsteps","subcategory":"chefsteps","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://www.chefsteps.com\") {\r\nhtml, body, p, li {    \r\n    font-family: Verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif !important;\r\n    font-size: 15px !important;\r\n    color: black !important;  \r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/105932/chef-steps-darker.user.js","style_settings":[]}
