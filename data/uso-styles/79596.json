For some reason Microsoft decided it would be smart to make this transparent, which means if your web browser has a dark background like mine, the page becomes black text on a dark grey background, and it's barely readable. This style simply gives it the same background as the main mail page and puts a little border between it and the list itself for clarity.","user":{"id":140931,"name":"DoomBoom","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":"All my stuff here is licensed under the WTFPL.\r\n\r\nSee: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL","license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2012-12-07T08:04:04.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":319,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/79596_after.jpeg?r=1588665963","url":"/styles/79596/outlook-contact-page-background-fix","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document\r\n url-prefix(http://*.mail.live.com),\r\n url-prefix(https://*.mail.live.com),\r\n domain(\"mail.live.com\") {\r\n\r\ndiv.ContactsContentBox {\r\n    background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243);\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv.ContactsListScrollable.sc {\r\n\tborder-top: 1px black solid;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
