{"id":79596,"name":"Outlook contact page background fix","description":"Small fix for the background of outlook.com(new hotmail)'s background of the contact page. For some reason Microsoft decided it would be smart to make this transparent, which means if your web browser has a dark background like mine, the page becomes black text on a dark grey background, and it's barely readable. This style simply gives it the same background as the main mail page and puts a little border between it and the list itself for clarity.","user":{"id":140931,"name":"DoomBoom","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":"All my stuff here is licensed under the WTFPL.\r\n\r\nSee: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL","license":null},"updated":"2012-12-07T08:04:04.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":322,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/79596_after.jpeg?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2012-12-07T08:04:04.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"live","subcategory":"live","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document\r\n url-prefix(http://*.mail.live.com),\r\n url-prefix(https://*.mail.live.com),\r\n domain(\"mail.live.com\") {\r\n\r\ndiv.ContactsContentBox {\r\n    background-color: rgb(243, 243, 243);\r\n}\r\n\r\ndiv.ContactsListScrollable.sc {\r\n\tborder-top: 1px black solid;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/79596/outlook-contact-page-background-fix.user.js","style_settings":[]}
