{"id":127464,"name":"Fark - Remove ads disguised as headlines","description":"With the Fark layout changes in April 2016 my ad and script blockers stopped being able to block the adverts that are in amongst the headlines. I whipped this up in two minutes to hide the class that those ads use. I created this purely for personal use with my specific plug-in and style configurations, so it might have unintended effects with your config, but figured I'd share. Use at your own risk, etc etc.","user":{"id":331136,"name":"p4riah","email":"thep4riah@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"updated":"2016-05-04T15:46:30.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":50,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/127464_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"ccbyncsa","created":"2016-05-04T15:46:30.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"fark","subcategory":"fark","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"fark.com\") {\r\n  .spau {display:none;}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/127464/fark-remove-ads-disguised-as-headlines.user.js","style_settings":[]}
