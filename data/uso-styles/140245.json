{"id":140245,"name":"Goodreads hide average ratings","description":"Hides average ratings on Goodreads because sometimes I want to browse book descriptions or update my lists for books that I have been recommended elsewhere before knowing what the general consensus is and creating an anchoring effect for my own read. Ratings by individuals will still show - considered hiding those as well but they are harder to run into accidentally so usually at that point I am actually looking for them.","user":{"id":406036,"name":"Sevly Soko (statesOfSevly)","email":"socialsevly@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"updated":"2019-03-27T04:48:36.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":146,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/140245_after.gif?r=1685001612","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2017-03-17T16:48:28.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"goodreads","subcategory":"goodreads","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"goodreads.com\") {\r\n\r\n  .avg_rating, .hreview-aggregate, .minirating, .recommendationsWidget .communityRating, [itemprop=\"aggregateRating\"] {\r\n    display: none;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/140245/goodreads-hide-average-ratings.user.js","style_settings":[]}
