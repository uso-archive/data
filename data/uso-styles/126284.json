This is ponybells' \"Fatbunny Creams\":\r\n  This style is only there to retune the overall appearance of\r\n  Inkbunny.net when people come to read stories.\r\n  \r\n  The story area has less padding to it, allowing for more story\r\n  to show per page, along with a one point reduction in font size\r\n  and an off-white background for the story section itself to \r\n  enhance readability.\r\n  \r\n  Please note: Due to there not being proper, unique anchor points\r\n  exclusive to stories, you will need to disable the theme for \r\n  non-story entries. Keep the Stylish icon up in the menu bar for \r\n  easy access.
