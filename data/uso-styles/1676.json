{"id":1676,"name":"Stylish Editor Window - Terminal Theme","description":"Based on \"After Hours Stylin\" (AHS) coded by Kid_ReeFer, \"Terminal Theme\" changes the Stylish editor window to green text on a black background and increases the size of the font. The coloring and larger font are easier to read than the blue in AHS and easier on the eyes than Stylish's original black on white\r\n.\r\nThe terminal look didn't match the overall effect of the After Hours theme so I decided to make a new style instead of submitting a fix to KR.\r\nProps to KR for the original idea.","user":{"id":1609,"name":"gzusphish","email":"wyatt.williamson@bearingpoint.","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-01-19T19:59:44.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1007,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/1676_after.png?r=1685174415","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-01-19T19:59:44.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"Stylish","subcategory":"Stylish","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n** Style coded by gzusphish 1/19/07\u003c\u003e\u003c\r\n** Based on After Hours Stylin****Coded by Kid_ReeFer\r\n** Liked the green coloring better than the blue in the original.
