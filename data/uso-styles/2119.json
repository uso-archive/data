{"id":2119,"name":"Wired - Cleaner","description":"A simple stylesheet to adjust the page to the lack of ads. Some nice black bars for the header, a slightly increased font size and less self promotion.\r\n\r\nFor advertising blocking purposes this style should be used in conjunction with the Adblock (Plus) extension. Adblock filters the content before it gets downloaded, thus saving you bandwidth. Stylish - which can only prevent ads from being displayed, not downloaded - is used to target what slips through Adblock's cracks and to eliminate the blank, white spaces that Adblock occasionally leaves behind.","user":{"id":1061,"name":"chochem","email":"chochem@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-04-21T11:18:47.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":563,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/2119_after.gif?r=1680854414","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-03-29T14:49:54.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"wired","subcategory":"wired","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/* by Chochem */\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"wired.com\") {\r\n\r\n/* header */\r\n   #logo_home, #header a, #header {\r\n\tbackground-color: black !important;\r\n\tposition: relative !important;\r\n\theight: auto !important;\r\n\t}\r\n   #stereo1, #stereo2, .timestamp\r\n\t{display: none !important;}\r\n\r\n/* articles */\r\n   #article {\r\n\ttext-align: justify !important;\r\n\tfont-size: 1.1em !important;\r\n\tline-height: 1.4em !important;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n/* sidebar */\r\n   #services,\r\n   .matchbook_bubble\r\n\t{display: none !important;}\r\n\r\n/* Footer */\r\n   #foot_row1, #foot_row2, #foot_row3 strong\r\n\t{display: none !important;}\r\n\r\n}\r\n","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/2119/wired-cleaner.user.js","style_settings":[]}
