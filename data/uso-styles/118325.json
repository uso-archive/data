{"id":118325,"name":"Trello: \"Add a new list\" becomes plus icon","description":"Makes the \"Add a new list\" very small, by replacing the text of the link with a \"plus\" icon. To gain some horizontal space, and sometimes avoid scrollbars.","user":{"id":126,"name":"Samuel Dellicour","email":"smd@samplify.be","paypal_email":"smd@samplify.be","homepage":"http://www.samplify.be","about":null,"license":"ccby"},"updated":"2015-09-01T23:35:21.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":410,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/118325_after.png?r=1679558415","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/118325_additional_16484.png?r=1679558415"],"license":null,"created":"2015-09-01T23:12:46.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"trello","subcategory":"trello","additional_info":"The downside is that when you click on that \"plus\" link, the dialogue (input form) is partly hidden. When that happens, either you need to scroll to bring it into view (which is not practical), or you simply start typing to write the new list title directly, then hit enter, and the new list will fully appear into view. \r\n\r\nMost useful when you don't often make new lists and like to reduce the horizontal space.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"trello.com\") {\r\n  \r\n    .list-wrapper.mod-add.is-idle {\r\n        width: 40px !important;\r\n    }\r\n    .list-wrapper.mod-add {}\r\n    .list-wrapper.mod-add .placeholder {\r\n        overflow: hidden;\r\n        height: 30px;\r\n        padding: 0;\r\n        margin: 17px 7px 5px;\r\n    }\r\n    .list-wrapper.mod-add .placeholder:before {\r\n        content: \"+\";\r\n        font-size: 30px;\r\n        display: block;\r\n        height: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n    .list-wrapper.mod-add.is-idle .placeholder {}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/118325/trello-add-a-new-list-becomes-plus-icon.user.js","style_settings":[]}
