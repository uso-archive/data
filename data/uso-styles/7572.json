{"id":7572,"name":"Remove (Hide) the Throbber Button","description":"Removes the Throbber Button icon from the Main (Navigation) Toolbar.   The throbber is the small circular clickable area on the top-right corner of your browser that animates when a page is loading. Gives you a larger area, and more screenspace for your browser.  Works for both Firefox 3 and Firefox 2.\r\n\r\n** Idea came from user 1's style 469.  Thanks Jason!\r\n\r\nIntegrates with Style 7174, and Style 7169, allowing you to remove the RSS Icon, the Bookmark favorite icon, and the Go Button.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n- Initial Release","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"benbenben3@msn.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-05-27T09:11:49.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":690,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/7572_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-05-27T09:11:49.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n___________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                               |\r\n|          Title:  |  Remove (Hide) the Throbber Button            |\r\n|    Description:  |  Hides the throbber from loading main toolbar |\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                      |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  May 27, 2008                                 |\r\n|   Date Updated:  |  May 27, 2008                                 |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.0                                      |\r\n|__________________|_______________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(\"http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul\");\r\n\r\n#throbber-box \r\n{\r\n  display: none !important; \r\n}","discussions":[{"id":14155,"name":"Not needed?","rating":0,"created":"2009-10-20T03:52:55.000Z","author_name":"auscompgeek","author_id":27745}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
