{"id":36526,"name":"Garry's Blog -- No Background Opacity","description":"Basically, this removes the translucent background image that exists on Garry's blog (garry.tv). This isn't much, but it is something that annoys me, and I wouldn't be surprised if it annoyed anyone else.\r\n\r\nOverall, this makes the layout look cleaner and the text more readable. The color used on the background color is default for the Wordpress theme.","user":{"id":61188,"name":"deadeye536","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2010-09-04T21:58:24.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":66,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/36526_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-09-04T21:53:26.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"garry","subcategory":"garry","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain('garry.tv'), domain('www.garry.tv') {\r\n    #main {\r\n    background-color: #F7F6F0 !important;\r\n    }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/36526/garry-s-blog-no-background-opacity.user.js","style_settings":[]}
