I can't stand  light gray fonts. They are hard to read. Unfortunately we live in a world where web designers are mostly in their 20s and all have perfect vision and the latest hardware.

Nothing fancy, just simple legibility.","license":"ccbysa"},"updated":"2014-10-12T14:46:44.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":65,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/102893_after.png?r=1678003216","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2014-06-27T18:56:36.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"180degreehealth","subcategory":"180degreehealth","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://180degreehealth.com\") {\r\nhtml, body, p, li {    \r\n    font-family: Verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif !important;\r\n    font-size: 15px !important;\r\n    color: black !important;  \r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/102893/180degreehealth-darker-larger.user.js","style_settings":[]}
