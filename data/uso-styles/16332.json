{"id":16332,"name":"New Facebook' - Minimize/Simplify Highlights Area","description":"This style does two main things:\r\n\r\n1) It shortens the 'highlights' area found on the home page after the most recent update, and adds a scroll bar. This makes it a bit easier to see the items found beneath the highlights area (like pokes, friends you may know, etc.)\r\n\r\n2) It removes the image/video preview pictures found with each highlight story. Again, I didn't find the previews to add anything useful to it, and this is a little more space efficient.","user":{"id":11558,"name":"aedes","email":"aedes.ag@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-03-23T18:02:13.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":1685,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/16332-after.png?r=1687075281","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-03-23T18:02:13.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"facebook","subcategory":"facebook","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"facebook.com\") {\r\n\r\n.UIHotStream.UIStream {\r\n  height:180px!important;\r\n  overflow-y:auto!important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.UIHotStory_Media {\r\n  display:none!important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n","discussions":[{"id":5439,"name":"prefer shrink photo as thumbs and shrink text size","rating":2,"created":"2009-03-31T04:19:43.000Z","author_name":"riow","author_id":3086},{"id":5462,"name":"Very good.
