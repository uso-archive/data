  "description": "Fun Fact!\r\nChrome has a built in Picture in Picture Mode, but why doesn't work on every site?\r\nWell its a lot variables, some could be because UI or other elements that hover over the video player are in the way. Some sites disable right click all together.\r\n\r\nBut as long as a video uses the standard video html tag then this should work.\r\nOnly catch is disable it if you want the video to resume using the original controls on the initial player. \r\n\r\nBest way to remember, ON when you want to use it, OFF when you're done.\r\nOnce ON just right click the video and pick Picture in Picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso I make these CSS stuff for myself but sometimes friends would come over and ask how I did that or how'd you do this. So I'd figure I give out my stuff for free. But.....\r\n\r\nYup there's a big ol' butt!\r\nIf you'd like to support me so I can keep making these on my free time here's my donorbox link:\r\n\r\nhttps://donorbox.org/helping-hand",
