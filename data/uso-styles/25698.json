This is because it uses Javascript to do so before the page has loaded. \r\n\r\n43marks uses the \"Prototype\" Javascript library's onready event, which seems to trigger before DOMContentLoaded time, ie Greasemonkey time. One way you can prevent this is to use the Firefox extension \"NoScript\" to disable Javascript to 43marks initially and only turn it on when you need it -- such as when rearranging bookmarks. This comes in especially handy if you use the Firefox extension \"NewTabURL\" to load 43marks every time you open a new tab. \r\n\r\nI have contacted the owner of 43marks (on Feb 19th 2010) about putting an option in the preferences to disable the search box and he said he'd ask his coders about it, so we'll see.","user":{"id":42833,"name":"rkulla","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-02-26T22:43:42.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":285,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/25698_after.png?r=1588061121","url":"/styles/25698/43marks-for-smaller-screens","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"43marks.com\") \r\n{   \r\n    /* Make the font size a little smaller */\r\n    body { \r\n        font-size: 72% !important; \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* Hide the logo and tagline */\r\n    #logo, .span-8 { \r\n        display: none !important; \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* Hide search box, tabs and text */\r\n    #search-box, #search-tabs, #start { \r\n        display: none !important; \r\n    }\r\n   \r\n    /* Shrink the height of the header */\r\n    #header { \r\n        height: 15px !important; \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* Shrink the permalink */\r\n    h2.bottom {\r\n        line-height: 15px !important; \r\n        font-size: 12px !important; \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* Hide the \"CUSTOMIZE YOURS - IT'S FREE!\" button */\r\n    .customize {\r\n        display: none !important;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* Shrink the 'Logout Settings Manage' links */\r\n    #customize a { \r\n        line-height: 15px !important;\r\n        font-size: 10px !important; \r\n    }\r\n   \r\n    /* Get rid of gap between header and bookmarks */\r\n    br { \r\n        display: none !important; \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* Shrink space between each listed book mark */\r\n    #bookmarks li {\r\n        line-height: 1.15em !important;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* ------- Uncomment CSS below to hide the footer ---------- */\r\n \r\n    /* Hide the horizontal rule */\r\n    /*\r\n    hr { \r\n        display: none !important;\r\n    }\r\n    */\r\n\r\n    /* Hide the \"Post to:\" stuff at bottom */\r\n    /* \r\n    #bottomnav { \r\n        display: none !important;\r\n    } \r\n    */\r\n\r\n    /* Hide the footer */\r\n    /* \r\n    #footer {\r\n        display: none !important; \r\n    } \r\n    */ \r\n}"}
