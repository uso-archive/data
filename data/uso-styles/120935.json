Turning this on will force hide the scrollbar on the game page and on Lichess TV. The extra spectators will never cause the browser to add a scrollbar when the page text overflows the height of your screen. This stops the board from shifting slightly to the left and right as the scrollbar appears and disappears.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document regexp(\".*lichess\\\\.org/tv.*\"), regexp(\".*lichess\\\\.org/(?=[\\\\w]{8}).*\") {\r\nhtml {\r\n    overflow-y:hidden\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n@-moz-document regexp(\".*lichess\\\\.org/tournament.*\"), regexp(\".*lichess\\\\.org/analysis.*\"), regexp(\".*lichess\\\\.org/training.*\"), regexp(\".*lichess\\\\.org/insights.*\"), regexp(\".*lichess\\\\.org/developers.*\") {\r\nhtml {\r\n    overflow-y:visible\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/120935/hide-scrollbar-during-games-on-lichess-org.user.js","style_settings":[]}
