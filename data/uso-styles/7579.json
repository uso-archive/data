Visually notifies you if you have a page to stop to by enabling the button!\r\n\r\nIntegrates with Style 7577, and Style 7575, allowing you to remove the Back and Forward icons until something to go back or forward to, and the Home toolbar Button.\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n-Initial Release","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"benbenben3@msn.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-05-27T12:53:50.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1069,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/7579_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-05-27T12:53:50.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n___________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                               |\r\n|          Title:  |  Hide Stop Button when Nothing to Stop        |\r\n|    Description:  |  Hidden if you cannot navigate forward or back|\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                      |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  May 27, 2008                                 |\r\n|   Date Updated:  |  May 27, 2008                                 |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.0                                      |\r\n|__________________|_______________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(\"http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul\");\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/* Remove Stop button: */\r\n#stop-button[disabled=\"true\"] \r\n{ \r\n  display: none; \r\n}","discussions":[{"id":8691,"name":"Great work... as usual !!!","rating":3,"created":"2008-05-28T13:39:06.000Z","author_name":"1337","author_id":2726}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
