  "description": "This is basically the same as style 9349 (9349), except that the location bar text is larger (110%) than the original,  so can it be seen better during presentations.   While the font is even larger than normal there is still a huge removal of wasted space from the Navigation/Location Bar.   \r\n\r\nThe idea here is to use minimum real estate used for the Navigation Toolbar, and other toolbars, so that you have more screen space to use your browser for it's intended purpose of looking at web pages not space hogging graphics. This style uses roughly about 1/3 of the height of the original Navigation  Toolbar and is the part shown within the red borders.  The rest of the styling comes from my other styles.",

  "additional_info": "This is one of several styles to minimize size of toolbars, look for other styles under my name, user 12592, at the top that include \"Minimal\" in their style names. Currently there is some overlap in toolbars, since I've not learned how to reduce the size of the selection bubbles to be within the toolbars height, but it is quite usable.\r\n\r\nI removed the search bar from the navigation bar to place it to the right of the menu bar (view, toolbars, customize), and also chose small icons at the bottom of customize,  so that both the location bar and the search bar have more working space. The search bar css code is commented out in this style, and is included with my Menu and Search bar style.\r\n\r\nMore information on styles that I use can be found on my Tabs page http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/tabs.htm#userstyles\r\nand in http://kb.mozillazine.org/User:Dmcritchie\r\n\r\nTo properly view the screenshots either right-click on an image then use \"View Image\" or install style 12373 (12373)  so that you can see images within userstyles.org in their actual image size.  The pictures are taken from screen shots with the window at 1/2 width so the search bar, and location bar are both wider by about  1/2 screen width  providing  very wide visible entry areas.   Also notice that the personal toolbar is almost entirely folders and removal of the folder icons with style 9091 (9091) provides about twice the space for folders.\r\n\r\nModification to use with Fx2  (you really should be using Fx3 by now)\r\n   change the two negative bottom margins to 0   (third parameter on margin:)\r\n\r\nI keep the Back & Forward buttons  to see if there is anything in either direction.\r\nI normally use  the BACK / FORWARD mouse button or keyboard shortcuts.\r\nThe following change removes  the dropdown on the unified-back-forward button\r\n #back-forward-dropmarker{display:none!important}   /* use Right-click to view dropdown */\r\n\r\nButtons you can easily eliminate with single key keyboard shortcuts  \r\nStop button,  use  Esc Key\r\nReload button,  use  F5 (Reload), or Shift+F5 (Reload page & ignore cache)\r\n\r\nButtons you could eliminate with keyboard shortcuts or keyworded bookmarklets as alternatives, but are very useful\r\nHome button,  use Home key which is often on the numeric keypad and toggled with NumLock\r\nNew Tab button,  use Ctrl+T to open a new tab, but the button has drag-and-drop capability \r\n\r\nAll of the style effects show in the After screenshot are from:\r\n* style 9514 (9514, available but was not used here)\r\n* style 9350 (9350)\r\n* style 10881 (10881 from this page)\r\n* style 13115(13115)\r\n* style 9091 (9091)\r\n* style 9043 (9043) \r\n\r\nUpdates: since 2008-09-30\r\n2009-01-05  adj Home, remove back-forward-dropmarker  right-click  to display menu (picture  not updated)",
