I try not to build up layers within a tab, so that I can tell for sure when I am finished with a tab.    Especially when reading Blogs where I start with several blogs by opening them from a folder on my bookmarks toolbar.\r\n\r\nIf \"private browsing\" for the active tab in particular can be determined might add an  dotted black  border  at top of tab.   [Unfortunately Private Browsing is all or nothing it is not per tab].\r\n   border-top: dotted 2px  #FF6600  !important;\r\n\r\nThis style can be used together  with  style 9043 (9043) by user 12592.\r\n\r\nProblem with Firefox 3.6 (Namoroka),  visited tabs appear same as unvisited tabs both are showing green underscores.   Works okay all versions through Firefox 3.5 (Shiretoko).  [see Bug 487242]  Please vote on getting the Bug fixed if you want to continue full benefits of this style in Firefox 3.6 and later.  With the ordering of new tabs opened in the background in 3.6 you will really need to know which tabs have been visited or and which are unvisited.   \r\n\r\nUpdates to code since 2008-07-24  (none)","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n/* Tab Color Underscoring active/read/unread (DM) */\r\n/* ===================================================== */\r\n\r\n/* leaving background  and focus rings alone so that background color\r\n   for Perma Tabs extension will prevail, but prefer Flat tabs usages */\r\n\r\n/* Change underline color of active tab  - RED */\r\ntab[selected=\"true\"] {\r\n   border-left: solid 1px #FF0000   !important;\r\n   border-bottom: solid 2px #FF0000   !important;\r\n   color: #000000 !important; }\r\n\r\n/* Change underline color of normal tabs  - BLUE */\r\ntab:not([selected=\"true\"]) {\r\n   border-left: solid 1px #0066CC   !important;\r\n   border-right: solid 1px  !important;\r\n   border-bottom: 2px solid #0066CC   !important;\r\n   color: black !important; }\r\n\r\n/* Change text and underline color of unread tabs - GREEN */\r\n/* http://kb.mozillazine.org/Change_the_style_of_tab_markers */\r\n #content tab:not([selected]) {\r\n  color: #005500 !important;\r\n  border-bottom: 2px solid #00BB00  !important;}\r\n","discussions":[{"id":9664,"name":"Great job! must have!","rating":3,"created":"2008-07-24T17:21:46.000Z","author_name":"Collage","author_id":3410}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
