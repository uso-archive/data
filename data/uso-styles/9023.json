In other words distinguishes tabs as active tab, viewed tab, unviewed tab.  Does not affect the background color of a tab  so that color usage of  \"Perma Tabs\"  (\"Perma Tabs Mod\"), and/or \"Multiple Tab Handler\"  extensions will prevail.",

I try not to build up layers within a tab, so that I can tell for sure when I am finished with a tab.    Especially when reading Blogs where I start with several blogs by opening them from a folder on my bookmarks toolbar.\r\n\r\nIf \"private browsing\" for the active tab in particular can be determined might add an  dotted black  border  at top of tab.   [Unfortunately Private Browsing is all or nothing it is not per tab].\r\n   border-top: dotted 2px  #FF6600  !important;\r\n\r\nThis style can be used together  with  style 9043 (9043) by user 12592.\r\n\r\nProblem with Firefox 3.6 (Namoroka),  visited tabs appear same as unvisited tabs both are showing green underscores.   Works okay all versions through Firefox 3.5 (Shiretoko).  [see Bug 487242]  Please vote on getting the Bug fixed if you want to continue full benefits of this style in Firefox 3.6 and later.  With the ordering of new tabs opened in the background in 3.6 you will really need to know which tabs have been visited or and which are unvisited.   \r\n\r\nUpdates to code since 2008-07-24  (none)",
