{"id":50260,"name":"Google Calendar -- Full Screen Calendar","description":"An update to my previous styles.  This new style incorporates/adjusts-to Google's June/July 2011 Calendar updates.  After applying this style, users will see the Google Search section disappear as well as the left-hand calendar tools.  \r\n\r\nSet you Calendar settings to \"Comfortable\".\r\n\r\n***NOTE*** Once this style is applied, you will NOT be able to change the colors of individual calendars, as these options are only accessible via the now-hidden, left-side panel.  Please set up your color schemes before enabling.  To make changes after enabling, please disable Stylish or unload this style.","user":{"id":43778,"name":"andrewkozak","email":null,"paypal_email":"andrew.kozak@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2014-12-30T03:22:24.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1480,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/50260-after.png?r=1679385616","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"ccby","created":"2011-07-03T19:18:05.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":"=== v2.31 === 29 Dec 2014 ===\r\n\r\nMore cleanup after Google changes.  ***Set Calendar to \"Comfortable\" mode***\r\n\r\n=== v2.2 === 24 Sep 2013 ===\r\n\r\nKeeping pace with Google's revisions.
