{"id":162610,"name":"Make Blackboard Black Again","description":"Makes Blackboard (and a couple of other things like Student One on the Swinburne network) a bit easier on the eyes, for when you're getting ready to start reviewing a subject at 2am of the morning of your exam. Generally. There's still some areas that are still too bright (or harder to read than they should be) that I'll probably never get around to fixing because I'm lazy and my course finishes after this semester.","user":{"id":681760,"name":"James Sanders","email":"mailerxxdaemon@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2018-07-17T12:55:48.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":14,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/162610_additional_31316.png?r=1678003216","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/162610_additional_31316.png?r=1678003216"],"license":"ccbyncsa","created":"2018-07-17T12:55:48.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"swin","subcategory":"swin","additional_info":"This style is in Beta. It will almost certainly never leave Beta.\r\nDo not expect anything to be fixed, updated, or improved.\r\nThe aforementioned CSS that I have written is pure spaghetti. It is poorly conceived, and perhaps even more poorly executed. If CSS has meaningful variables, I'd probably name them after boats.\r\nIf you're intending to try and improve my terrible code, I'd suggest that you instead just start from scratch. It'll probably be easier and better that way.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"swin.edu.au\") {\r\n/*** Only optimized for iLearn.
