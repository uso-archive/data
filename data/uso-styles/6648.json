Simply enable this style while you're editing and the \"Journal Entries\" column will disappear, allowing the \"New Journal Entry\" column to take up the whole page width.\r\n\r\nEdit: I originally made it, by mistake, so that the bloody thing only works when making a _new_ journal. Now it's fixed to work when updating old journals as well.","user":{"id":7726,"name":"Abfc","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-04-23T20:44:26.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":387,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/6648_after.png?r=1679731214","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-04-23T16:13:03.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"deviantart","subcategory":"deviantart","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://my.deviantart.com/journal/\") {\r\n\r\ndiv.column2 { display: none !important; }\r\ndiv.column1 { width: 100% !important; }\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":1175,"name":"Journal entry screen wider.","rating":0,"created":"2008-05-01T10:29:01.000Z","author_name":"houstonaxl","author_id":8358}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/6648/more-journal-editing-space.user.js","style_settings":[]}
