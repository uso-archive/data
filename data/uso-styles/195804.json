{"id":195804,"name":"Hide Karma/Scores But Keep Voting Buttons","description":"Do you want to avoid being influenced by other people's votes without giving up your ability to vote? Look no further. This userstyle hides post, comment, and user karma, but unlike Hide All Karma and similar styles, it does not hide voting buttons. So you can think freely while still casting your votes.\r\n\r\nJust like regular posts that have their score hidden, the number of votes next to each post will be replaced with a dot. This has two advantages: it's visually consistent with the rest of reddit, and it doesn't alter the layout of your feed.","user":{"id":1104360,"name":"John Fortnite Kennedy","email":"hugokim2310@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2021-01-12T05:42:11.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":282,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/195804_after.png?r=1687420883","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2021-01-12T05:42:11.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"reddit","subcategory":"reddit","additional_info":"Note: this only works on old reddit.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"reddit.com\") {\r\n.stickied .score { font-size: 0; }\r\n.stickied .score:after { content: '•'; font-size: small; }\r\n\r\n.score { font-size: 0; }\r\n.score:after { content: '•'; font-size: small; }\r\n\r\n.linkinfo \u003e .score {display: none;}\r\n\r\n.titlebox \u003e .karma {font-size:0px !important;color:transparent !important;}\r\n.titlebox \u003e .karma::before {font-size:12px !important;color:black !important;content:'NaN';}\r\n\r\nthing_t1_cih4b9q \u003e .unvoted.entry \u003e .tagline \u003e .unvoted.score {visibility: hidden;}\r\n\r\n.comment .tagline .score { display: none; }\r\n\r\n.userkarma { display: none; }\r\n.user { font-size: 0; }\r\n.user a { font-size: 10px; }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/195804/hide-karma-scores-but-keep-voting-buttons.user.js","style_settings":[]}
