{"id":19140,"name":"TeamXbox forum: View high-res images easily","description":"Trying to view high-resolution images posted on forum.teamxbox.com is a pain. Install this to view them easily.\r\n\r\nOversized images that needed a scrollbar will be scaled to fit the forum post width. Mouse-over images to view them full-size. If viewing a single post (click #postcount in the top right of a post), images will be their original size without needing to hover over them. \r\n\r\nThe only limitation now is your resolution, not the forum width (552px). If you still need to scroll, use the arrow keys or 'right-click \u003e View Image'.\r\n\r\nScreenshots: before, after, hover, view Single Post: http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/2143/changesn.jpg\r\n\r\nTry style 20126 if you want the forums to be wider overall.","user":{"id":25441,"name":"WataKKo","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-08-10T11:53:37.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":477,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":null,"obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-07-01T15:43:44.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"teamxbox","subcategory":"teamxbox","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"forum.teamxbox.com\")\r\n{\r\n[action=\"showpost.php\"] .scrollimg { width: 100% !important}\r\n.scrollimg img {max-width:100%}\r\n.scrollimg:hover {width:100% !important; position:relative}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/19140/teamxbox-forum-view-high-res-images-easily.user.js","style_settings":[]}
