Disabled the sidebar changes until I have time to do a larger rework of that\r\n[12-12-2013] Fixed the annotation overlay for the HTML5 player while watching \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7jtC8vjXw8\"\u003eYouTube Rewind: What Does 2013 Say?\u003c/a\u003e\r\n[04-12-2013] Fixed support for the HTML5 player while watching \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAEIMx39-w\"\u003eThe World Outside My Window - Time Lapse of Earth from the ISS (4K)\u003c/a\u003e. Thanks Cloonaid for reporting. Fixed two-column related-videos view in the process.\r\n[31-10-2013] Small fiddly things. Playlist list div changed width.\r\n[16-08-2013] Youtube is moving to a new layout? Some classes have -legacy as postfix now. Also fixed sidebar, two columns again. They keep mixing large, wide and medium terminology...\r\n[31-05-2013] Some sidebar pixel nudging. And a class change.\r\n[24-04-2013] Weird stuff, some centering suddenly moved the entire layout. Commented the line out. Do not update unless you experience issues!\r\n[16-04-2013] Sidebar also works for when the large-layout actually works.\r\n[21-03-2013] Playlist bugged out. Fixed.\r\n[20-03-2013] Small CSS change which I missed. Sidebar is now double-row'd again.\r\n[20-03-2013] They changed some names around, but seem to using the old as well. Added the new names, kept the old ones in, so both work now.\r\n[09-12-2012] Youtube's... layout overhaul. Fixed it, 720p again. Also changed the playlist-bar and sidebar to match the width. Sidebar especially now shows 2 rows, instead of one. I like it, and it fits perfectly in the created free space.\r\n[11-10-2012] Added support for Youtube's new layout, old code still included, not everyone has changed it seems.\r\n[20-06-2012] Fixed width back to 1280px again, the video got noticeably blurry and it didn't seem to fix any problems. Removed the black borders too by decreasing the height to 750px.\r\n[07-05-2012] Whatever youtube did, I don't understand. Had to make the player a little bigger to have it automatically select 720p.\r\n[01-03-2012] Youtube did something funny to #watch-video, a fixed with. Fixed it, and was able to simplify the code even. Works perfectly again.\r\n[23-02-2012] Youtube changed .wide to .medium, supported now. Seems they might add an actual native .wide later on. Also somehow the glitch is fixed where you had to resize small\u0026large.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"youtube.com\") {\r\n/* html5 */\r\n[data-player-size=large] .watch-medium .video-stream.html5-main-video {\r\n  \twidth: 1280px !important;\r\n\theight: 720px !important;\r\n}\r\n.watch-medium .html5-video-content {\r\n    zoom: 1.5;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* main, includes some old selectors. */\r\n#page.watch-medium #watch7-video, #page .watch-medium #watch7-video, #page .watch-medium #player, #page .watch-medium #player-legacy, #player.watch-medium {\r\n\twidth: 1280px !important;\r\n}\r\n#page.watch-medium #watch7-player, #page .watch-medium #watch7-player, #page .watch-medium #player-api, #page .watch-medium #player-api-legacy {\r\n\twidth: 1280px !important;\r\n\theight: 750px !important;\r\n\t\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* useless after c#1, but does not conflict. */\r\n.watch-medium .watch7-playlist-bar-left {\r\n\twidth: 980px !important;\r\n}\r\n.watch-medium #watch7-playlist-tray-container {\r\n\tleft: 980px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.watch-medium #watch7-playlist-tray-container {\r\n\theight: 720px !important;\r\n}\r\n.watch-playlist-collapsed #watch7-playlist-tray-container {\r\n\theight: 0 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.watch-medium .watch7-playlist-bar, .watch-medium #watch7-main {\r\n\twidth: 1280px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Sidebar. disabled at c#1, need to move more elements around to reenable it (entire layout wider, playlist wider)\r\n.watch-medium #watch7-sidebar, .watch-large #watch7-sidebar, .watch-wide #watch7-sidebar {\r\n\twidth: 610px;\r\n\tmax-width: 610px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.watch-medium .watch-sidebar-body li, .watch-large .watch-sidebar-body li, .watch-wide .watch-sidebar-body li {\r\n\tdisplay: inline-block !important;\r\n\twidth: 300px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.watch-medium #watch-more-related-button, .watch-large #watch-more-related-button, .watch-wide #watch-more-related-button {\r\n\tmargin-left: 305px;\r\n}\r\n*/\r\n\r\n/* Legacy shizzle\r\n#watch-video.large #watch-player, #watch-video.medium #watch-player{\r\n\theight: 750px !important;\r\n\tmargin: 0 auto !important;\r\n}\r\n#watch-video.medium, #watch-video.large, #watch-video.large #watch-player, #watch-video.medium #watch-player {\r\n\twidth: 1280px !important;\r\n}\r\n*/\r\n\r\n/*\r\nYT change counter\r\nc#1 21-02-2014\r\n*/\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":31632,"name":"Works great","rating":3,"created":"2012-06-30T01:42:10.000Z","author_name":"TheInimitable","author_id":148133},{"id":33613,"name":"Workaround for the new Youtube layout (December 07 2012)","rating":3,"created":"2012-12-08T00:47:46.000Z","author_name":"kage0110","author_id":169329},{"id":33793,"name":"Thanks for the update","rating":3,"created":"2012-12-15T12:13:12.000Z","author_name":"CubeS","author_id":108073},{"id":39206,"name":"Awesome style","rating":3,"created":"2013-11-27T07:39:04.000Z","author_name":"Cloonaid","author_id":164052}],"discussionsCount":4,"commentsCount":13,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/57985/youtube-720p-layout.user.js","style_settings":[]}
