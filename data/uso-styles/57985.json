Also tweaks the featured-sidebar to fill the newly created whitespace by creating two columns instead of one.\r\n\r\nI use it myself, so when it breaks will mostly be updated in less than a day.",

  "additional_info": "[24-02-2014] Small fix for fullscreen HTML5\r\n[21-02-2014] Youtube overhauled the player page. Disabled the sidebar changes until I have time to do a larger rework of that\r\n[12-12-2013] Fixed the annotation overlay for the HTML5 player while watching <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7jtC8vjXw8\">YouTube Rewind: What Does 2013 Say?</a>\r\n[04-12-2013] Fixed support for the HTML5 player while watching <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOAEIMx39-w\">The World Outside My Window - Time Lapse of Earth from the ISS (4K)</a>. Thanks Cloonaid for reporting. Fixed two-column related-videos view in the process.\r\n[31-10-2013] Small fiddly things. Playlist list div changed width.\r\n[16-08-2013] Youtube is moving to a new layout? Some classes have -legacy as postfix now. Also fixed sidebar, two columns again. They keep mixing large, wide and medium terminology...\r\n[31-05-2013] Some sidebar pixel nudging. And a class change.\r\n[24-04-2013] Weird stuff, some centering suddenly moved the entire layout. Commented the line out. Do not update unless you experience issues!\r\n[16-04-2013] Sidebar also works for when the large-layout actually works.\r\n[21-03-2013] Playlist bugged out. Fixed.\r\n[20-03-2013] Small CSS change which I missed. Sidebar is now double-row'd again.\r\n[20-03-2013] They changed some names around, but seem to using the old as well. Added the new names, kept the old ones in, so both work now.\r\n[09-12-2012] Youtube's... layout overhaul. Fixed it, 720p again. Also changed the playlist-bar and sidebar to match the width. Sidebar especially now shows 2 rows, instead of one. I like it, and it fits perfectly in the created free space.\r\n[11-10-2012] Added support for Youtube's new layout, old code still included, not everyone has changed it seems.\r\n[20-06-2012] Fixed width back to 1280px again, the video got noticeably blurry and it didn't seem to fix any problems. Removed the black borders too by decreasing the height to 750px.\r\n[07-05-2012] Whatever youtube did, I don't understand. Had to make the player a little bigger to have it automatically select 720p.\r\n[01-03-2012] Youtube did something funny to #watch-video, a fixed with. Fixed it, and was able to simplify the code even. Works perfectly again.\r\n[23-02-2012] Youtube changed .wide to .medium, supported now. Seems they might add an actual native .wide later on. Also somehow the glitch is fixed where you had to resize small&large.",
