This feature was already available from the list of tags at the end of the article.\r\n\r\nThe automatic links are confusing whenever there are \"real\" links on a page.\r\n\r\nThis style fixes the problem by coloring the automatic links green (to somewhat match the kotaku theme) rather than the standard red.","user":{"id":3055,"name":"RDaneel","email":"sandrewjohnson@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-06-29T12:16:16.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":291,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/2643-after.png?r=1676880016","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-06-18T13:20:25.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"kotaku","subcategory":"kotaku","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"kotaku.com\") {\r\n\r\n/* recolors autolinks */\r\n.tagautolink {color:green !important}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/2643/kotaku-com-autolinks.user.js","style_settings":[]}
