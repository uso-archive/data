This feature was already available from the list of tags at the end of the article.\r\n\r\nThe automatic links are confusing whenever there are \"real\" links on a page.\r\n\r\nThis style fixes the problem by coloring the automatic links green (to somewhat match the kotaku theme) rather than the standard red.","user":{"id":3055,"name":"RDaneel","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2007-06-29T12:16:16.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":282,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/2643-after.png?r=1588493039","url":"/styles/2643/kotaku-com-autolinks","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"kotaku.com\") {\r\n\r\n/* recolors autolinks */\r\n.tagautolink {color:green !important}\r\n\r\n}"}
