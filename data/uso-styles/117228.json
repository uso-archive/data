After noticing that many of the sites I use regularly didn't have any dark styles (or any styles at all for that matter), I decided to upload my own for any other sufferers (or just anyone else who likes a darker look) to use. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am in no way an expert. I am aware that most of my styles are far from perfect, but they work for what I use them for. I learned a lot of what I know from just looking at other people's styles I've used in the past; as such, everyone is welcome to make whatever changes are needed to my styles to suit their own usage/tastes (if you need help, just ask).\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has contributed to this great utility, and eternal thanks to Stylish for being exactly what lets me enjoy the web!\r\n\r\nPS. I use the FT DeepDark theme and styles for Firefox by Steva/Sr21, so my dark color scheme is similar to that (although I make mine a touch darker). If you want different colors, everything should be easily changeable.","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-08-09T18:05:18.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":54,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/117228-after.png?r=1551513678","url":"/styles/117228/seraphim-dark-nova","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"seraphimsl.com\") {\r\n\r\nhtml, body, .container, .left-shadow, .right-shadow\r\n{color: white !important;\r\nbackground: #111 !important;}\r\n  \r\na\r\n{color: #00adee !important;}\r\n  \r\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, strong, p\r\n{color: white !important;}   \r\n  \r\n#footer, #comment-wrap, #et-social-icons \r\n{display: none !important;} \r\n  \r\n.et-tabs-container, .et-tabs-control\r\n{color: white !important;\r\nbackground: #222 !important;}  \r\n  \r\n.et-tabs-container .et-tabs-control li.active a\r\n{color: white !important;\r\nbackground: #111 !important;}    \r\n  \r\n.et-tabs-control li, .et-tabs-container .et-tabs-control li a, .et-tabs-container .et-tabs-control li.active a  \r\n{text-shadow: none !important;\r\nbox-shadow: none !important;} \r\n  \r\n#slb_viewer_wrap .slb_theme_slb_baseline .slb_container\r\n{color: white !important;\r\nbackground: #222 !important;\r\nbox-shadow: none !important;}  \r\n  \r\n}"}
