{"id":100963,"name":"LiveJournal Error Page Edit","description":"A simple style that changes the creepy goat on the LiveJournal error page to a sad cartoon character, which gets the point across without being disturbing (although you can change the image by replacing the bit.ly url in the code if you would prefer a different picture). Huge thanks to qwerty321 for making a joke error page so I could take some of the code for this style and to cartoonfaces.net for the stock picture.","user":{"id":263855,"name":"SharonaParadox","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2014-04-29T23:23:22.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":144,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/100963_after.png?r=1676620818","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"publicdomain","created":"2014-04-29T23:23:22.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"livejournal","subcategory":"livejournal","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"livejournal.com\") {\r\n.error-page .pic {\r\n    width: 0px !important;\r\n    padding-right: 370px !important;\r\n    left: -50px !important;\r\n    background-image: url('http://bit.ly/1fNWgHJ') !important;\r\n    background-repeat: no-repeat !important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/100963/livejournal-error-page-edit.user.js","style_settings":[]}
