This is because hulu.com doesn't change it, and hence I had no way to target it only when the lights where out. Personally, I didn't like the gradient anyhow, but I thought I should mention it.","user":{"id":608,"name":"thespook","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"gotspook@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-05-20T06:10:35.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1454,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/7378-after.png?r=1590653221","url":"/styles/7378/hulu-com-lights-out","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.hulu.com\") {\r\n#overlay-top, #overlay-bottom{opacity:1!important}\r\n\r\n#description-container[style*=\"rgb(51, 51, 51)\"]{background:#000!important}\r\n#description-container[style*=\"rgb(51, 51, 51)\"] *{color:#000!important}\r\n#description-container[style*=\"rgb(51, 51, 51)\"] h2 span{color:#222!important;padding-left:60px!important;display:block}\r\n\r\n#breakout-container{background:#000!important}\r\n}"}
