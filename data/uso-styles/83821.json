If there's a problem, feel free to fix it.\r\n\r\nThey'are all based on the assumption that you want to read the archive without having to look for the \"next\" button each time. I'm using a wireless mouse, so it's nice to sit back and just click without first moving around.","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2013-04-24T12:24:26.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":30,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/83821-after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"publicdomain","created":"2013-03-02T05:03:14.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"lfgcomic","subcategory":"lfgcomic","additional_info":"Feel free to improve.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.lfgcomic.com\") {\r\n\r\n#nav-next\r\n{\r\n   position:fixed;\r\n   right: 20px;\r\n   top: 10%;\r\n   background-color: maroon;\r\n   border: 1px solid red;\r\n   z-index: 999;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/83821/lfg-comic-next.user.js","style_settings":[]}
