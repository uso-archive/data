{"id":6873,"name":"Experts Exchange - nothing but answers","description":"The Experts Exchange site really annoys me.  If you're not a member, they still give you the answers, but they make you scroll way down to the bottom of the page first.  This script removes *all* that crap and reduces the page to the bare minimum necessary, just the question and the answers.  It's not overly pretty, but I find beauty in minimalism.  What matters to me here is the content.","user":{"id":8325,"name":"Xanthir","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-05-02T16:20:19.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":472,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/6873-after.png?r=1684224017","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-05-02T16:20:19.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"experts-exchange","subcategory":"experts-exchange","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(www.experts-exchange.com) {\r\n\r\n.squareSignUp, .squareSignUpWide, #relatedSolutions20X6, .lightImage, .light20, .freePAQ, .blurredAnswer, .sectionFour, .qStats, #pageRight, table.h, .infoCol, .ontopBanner, #pageHeader, #breadCrumb, #pageFooter, .qTagRow, .questionScore, .qZoneRow\r\n{ display: none !important; }\r\n\r\n* { width: auto !important; max-width: none !important; background: none !important; }\r\n\r\n.infoBody { margin-left: 0 !important; background: #eee !important; }\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":8383,"name":"One has to be a fool to pay expensive subscription","rating":1,"created":"2008-05-03T09:53:56.000Z","author_name":"Mo Husen","author_id":3177},{"id":8090,"name":"Nice!
