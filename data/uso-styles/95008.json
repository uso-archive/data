My work and play cross paths often since I get a lot of joy out of what I do and study, some of which are:\r\n\r\n- Perl + CPAN Developer\r\n- Linux C++ Developer (Qt4, Qt5, KDE4, KFM5, and related)\r\n- Shell Script Developer (Perl, BASH, sh, upstart, vim plugin development)\r\n- Web Style Developer (CSS, SaSS, SGML, HTML5, etc) though I do know HTML4 too [who doesn't?]\r\n- Windows C++ Developer (Old Pro in Microsoft related technologies)\r\n- Old-School Technologies (qbasic, vbdos, borland c++, ms-dos 6.66, i386 assembler /w emphasis on _some_ 64-bit stuff)\r\n- Music Hobbyist (Electronic Music Writer, Piano, Keyboard player/Enthusiast)\r\n- Graphic Artist (Pencil/Pen/Watercolor physical media, Maya/Blender/3DSMax/Bryce/Gimp/Photoshop HD and post-production)\r\n\r\nI am not currently in any group at the time. I am not sure if I will be doing that ever again. The last few groups I participated in were too incoherent and seemed to have different ideals, ethics, goals. \r\n\r\nI am open to suggestion or requests, just don't make them impossible for a single person to do. Requesting a theme have a black version is probably okay. Requesting that I personally show up and restyle your entire website is probably not. Of course, if I were getting paid to do it, that would be a whole other matter, but I rarely see people paying for such things these days when you can hire someone in another country to do it for 2 cents -- that's right I'm a bitter man :D= <- those are vampire teeth!!","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2013-11-11T05:57:32.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":247,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/95008_after.jpeg?r=1593677211","url":"/styles/95008/doxygen-black","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/*change the url below to another site containing doxygen pages to use this style on it, im not sure\r\nif it works for that (yet), but am planning on adding support for this in later revisions if i get around to it */\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen\") \r\n{\r\n body\r\n {\r\n   background-color: transparent !important;\r\n   background-image: radial-gradient(ellipse farthest-corner at left bottom, #000 0%, #242424 50%, #222 75%, #222 87.5%, #333 93.75%, #666 96.875%, #888 100%) !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* adbar and social network buttons (hide) */\r\n.pageheader > tbody:nth-child(1) > tr:nth-child(1) > td:nth-child(3) > form:nth-child(1) > table:nth-child(8),\r\n.pageheader > tbody:nth-child(1) > tr:nth-child(1) > td:nth-child(2)\r\n{\r\n/*remove this line below if you want the chat icons back (and the adbar) */\r\ndisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#projectlogo > a:nth-child(1) > img:nth-child(1)\r\n{\r\n  width: 0px !important;\r\n  height: 30px !important;\r\n  margin-top: 0px !important;\r\n  padding-left: 106px;\r\n  top:  4px !important;\r\n  left: 8px;\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n\r\n  background-image: url(\"http://gnuradio.org/doc/doxygen/doxygen.png\") !important; \r\n}\r\n#side-nav\r\n{\r\n top: inherit !important;\r\n}\r\n#titlearea\r\n{\r\n  height: 40px;\r\n}\r\n#navrow1\r\n{\r\n height: 30px;\r\n overflow: hidden;\r\n font-size: 8px !important;\r\n top: 10px !important;\r\n position: absolute;\r\n left: 120px\r\n}\r\n\r\nbody *\r\n{\r\n   color: ivory;\r\n   background: transparent !important;\r\n   \r\n}\r\n\r\nbody a\r\n{\r\n   color:#6688FF !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n}"}
