{"id":206330,"name":"100% Width - MoneySavingExpert Forums","description":"This will cause the forum to stretch to the full width of your browser window. If this is too big Iâ€™ve also done a 90% and 75%.\r\n\r\nIf you want a different width, just edit the style through Stylus and change the percentage, it is very easy!\r\n\r\nThis can be installed along with one of the Declutter styles.\r\n\r\nNOTE: MSE are changing the forum quite a lot at the moment so expect this style to break if they do anything. If something seems wrong please disable all styles first to check.","user":{"id":132389,"name":"f300","email":"f300rc@googlemail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2021-06-20T13:51:07.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":3,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/206330_after.jpeg?r=1687075216","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"publicdomain","created":"2021-06-20T13:51:07.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"moneysavingexpert","subcategory":"moneysavingexpert","additional_info":"v1.0.0\r\nFirst version","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"forums.moneysavingexpert.com\") {\r\n\r\n.Container {\r\n    max-width: 100% !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/206330/100-width-moneysavingexpert-forums.user.js","style_settings":[]}
