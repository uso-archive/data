{"id":606,"name":"ScrollButtons Change Color","description":"As of the latest 2.0a3 Nightly Branch Builds, you get arrows on either side of tabs, so multiple tabs can be \"scrolled.\"  Kinda cool.  However, I didnt' like the \"tiny transparent white\" markers - this is a \"dramatic color\" to show off the end button - but change to your liking.  I colorize active tab \"green\" and cut opacity on non-active; all I have to do now is make the arrow larger and I'll be set.  White arrow on black background would be cool . . . I'll work on it.","user":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","paypal_email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2006-07-06T16:40:55.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":601,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/606_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-07-06T16:40:55.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*Coded by Paulfox July 7th 2006 Ver 1.0 */\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n.scrollbutton-up, .scrollbutton-down {background-color: #FF66FF !important; }","discussions":[{"id":14906,"name":"Works great - thanks!","rating":0,"created":"2009-11-20T18:36:06.000Z","author_name":"cniggeler","author_id":32807},{"id":14907,"name":"Works great - thanks!","rating":3,"created":"2009-11-20T18:37:12.000Z","author_name":"cniggeler","author_id":32807}],"discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
