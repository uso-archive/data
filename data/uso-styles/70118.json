This time I just kept throwing elements at it till everything I didn't want to see was hidden again. Hopefully this version will last longer than the last.\r\n06.04.14: Oh for crap's sake they changed it again... I'll see if i can fix it again.\r\n05.20.14: Fixed again, no idea how long it was broke this time.\r\n10.07.13: At some point between when I made this and now they made a change to the site which resulted in the old version stopping the rain sound. Instead of figuring out how to continue using the old way I just remade it using a different method to hide stuff. Only tested in ff24.0.",
