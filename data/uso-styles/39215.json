{"id":39215,"name":"Max width","description":"Because wider isn't always better.\r\n\r\nHave you ever tried reading text across 1300 or 1700 pixels?  How about those sites that cram everything into the left 800 pixels?\r\n\r\nThis style creates a maximum 1011 pixel space in the middle of the screen and places the current content inside of it.\r\n\r\nWhy 1011 pixels?  Because that's the usable space on a 1024x768 monitor with a scrollbar.  If you use the same stylish.sqlite across multiple computers you won't even notice it on a 1024 monitor.  You can adjust this number a couple of pixels either way depending on the width of your scrollbar.  Adjust it so that you don't see the borders on a 1024 monitor.\r\n\r\nThis style is not intended to be used globally, just where a wide screen looks awkward.  I've included plenty of examples but you will have to add your own domains and url-prefixes.\r\n\r\nYou may occasionally see something outside of the box.  This usually means that the page you are viewing has styled an element as \"position:absolute\" and you will have to live with it or edit the page's css.\r\n\r\n","user":{"id":202,"name":"Webb","email":"webbpa@justice.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2010-10-31T12:42:43.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":571,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/39215_after.gif?r=1686384016","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-10-31T12:42:43.000Z","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/* These are functional examples - add more */\r\nurl-prefix(http://online.wsj.com/article),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/print/),\r\ndomain(cbsnews.com),domain(reuters.com),\r\ndomain(listverse.com),domain(prx.org),\r\ndomain(craigslist.org),domain(wired.com),\r\ndomain(ixquick.com),domain(archive.org),\r\ndomain(amazon.com),domain(news.yahoo.com)\r\ndomain(qdb.us)domain(absurdlycool.com){\r\n\r\n/* This is the actual code */\r\nHTML\r\n{background-color:#E0FFFF !important;\r\n height:auto !important}\r\nHTML\u003eBODY{max-width:1011px !important;\r\n margin-left:auto !important;\r\n margin-right:auto !important;\r\n border:1px solid gray !important}}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/39215/max-width.user.js","style_settings":[]}
