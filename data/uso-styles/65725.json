{"id":65725,"name":"Slate Slideshow - Larger Description Area","description":"Slate's slideshows inexplicably always cram the descriptive text into a little box that's only a fraction of the image's size, forcing the user to scroll (and scroll back up to the top after going to the next slide).  This style lengthens that text box to roughly the size of the image, makes the font slightly smaller and turns it black for readability.","user":{"id":134684,"name":"Sosarian","email":"xyzzymagic@hotmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2012-05-16T02:13:27.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":68,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/65725_after.jpeg?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2012-05-16T02:13:27.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"slate","subcategory":"slate","additional_info":"I've done what I can to describe the changes I made with comments, so others can tweak settings to match their needs.
