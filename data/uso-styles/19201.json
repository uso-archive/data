{"id":19201,"name":"We're All Equal @ The Sixtyone","description":"Color all Listener names at thesixtyone.com black.\r\n\r\nIt's a small set of working style rules, but you should consider it as a kind of statement. Ever since listener name coloring was introduced to show how much money people spend on artists, I feel uncomfortable listening to music for free. I don't credit artists or buy their mp3 albums for my own valid reasons, yet I agree that most artists deserve some earnings. If only they could make a clear choice between playing for money or playing for free. I hate peer pressure as a marketing scheme.","user":{"id":25042,"name":"Evony","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-07-03T06:16:45.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":82,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":null,"obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-07-03T06:16:45.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"thesixtyone","subcategory":"thesixtyone","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.thesixtyone.com\") {\r\n\r\na.username { color: #000 ! important; }\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/19201/we-re-all-equal-the-sixtyone.user.js","style_settings":[]}
