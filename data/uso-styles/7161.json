{"id":7161,"name":"Steam Powered User Forums Bold Fix","description":"This style is for users who currently enjoy everything about the new forum theme, aside from the pesky bold. It's a simple fix, and will only affect text without the [b][/b] tags. Text that is supposed to be bold, and has the [b][/b] tags will still be bold.","user":{"id":8802,"name":"AbJ32","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-05-11T11:15:34.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":221,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/7161_after.png?r=1687161611","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-05-11T11:15:34.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"steampowered","subcategory":"steampowered","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"forums.steampowered.com\") {\r\n.tcat { font-weight : normal !important; }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/7161/steam-powered-user-forums-bold-fix.user.js","style_settings":[]}
