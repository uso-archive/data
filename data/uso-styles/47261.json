{"id":47261,"name":"Prettier AU Access - Auburn.edu","description":"When I logged into AU Access for the first time, I didn't find the visual style appealing at all. Less than seven hours later, I wrote the first version of this style. It should iron out many of the kinks in the style, and make it much prettier and maybe even easier to use.\r\n\r\nI hope to keep this updated as long as I have an AU access account, so at least the next four years. If you want a specific page fixed, comment on this style.","user":{"id":93284,"name":"afontenot","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbysa"},"updated":"2013-08-10T14:03:53.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":215,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/47261_after.jpeg?r=1676793615","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"ccbyncsa","created":"2011-04-28T21:14:53.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"auburn","subcategory":"auburn","additional_info":"0.2.0 Auburn makes changes 2013-08-10\r\nAuburn made a bunch of changes.
