Cleans up the page when you're tracking a package. \r\nWhat you see on the screenshot is supposed to be what's left on the page (works at the moment of posting).\r\n\r\nApplies to the tracking page only, i.e. starting with:\r\nhttps://www.canadapost.ca/cpotools/apps/track/personal/findByTrackNumber\r\n\r\nAlthough please feel free to customize that, or anything else.
