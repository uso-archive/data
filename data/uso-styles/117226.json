After noticing that many of the sites I use regularly didn't have any dark styles (or any styles at all for that matter), I decided to upload my own for any other sufferers (or just anyone else who likes a darker look) to use. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am in no way an expert. I am aware that most of my styles are far from perfect, but they work for what I use them for. I learned a lot of what I know from just looking at other people's styles I've used in the past; as such, everyone is welcome to make whatever changes are needed to my styles to suit their own usage/tastes (if you need help, just ask).\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has contributed to this great utility, and eternal thanks to Stylish for being exactly what lets me enjoy the web!\r\n\r\nPS. I use the FT DeepDark theme and styles for Firefox by Steva/Sr21, so my dark color scheme is similar to that (although I make mine a touch darker). If you want different colors, everything should be easily changeable.","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-08-11T03:39:46.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":44,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/117226-after.png?r=1570953699","url":"/styles/117226/designingsl-dark-nova","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"designingsl.com\") {\r\n\r\nhtml, body, .sticky-wrapper\r\n{color: white !important;\r\nbackground: #111 !important;}\r\n  \r\na\r\n{color: #00adee !important;}\r\n  \r\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6\r\n{color: white !important;}   \r\n  \r\naside#php_widget-2, aside#php_widget-3, aside#meta-2, aside#googleplus-badge-2, aside#facebook-likebox-2, aside#execphp-2, div.sharedaddy, #corncurl-cont,  #corncurl-bg, #corncurl-peel, #corncurl-small-img, .nav-search, #execphp-3, #sidebar-footer, .site-footer \r\n{display: none !important;}  \r\n\r\n.post-content, .widget-area, .ai1ec-agenda-widget-view .ai1ec-date, .entry-summary div, .entry-content div, .single .hentry\r\n{color: white !important;\r\nbackground: #222 !important;} \r\n  \r\n.nav-previous, .nav-next\r\n{color: white !important;\r\nbackground: #222 !important;\r\nbox-shadow: none !important;}   \r\n  \r\n.widget-area, .hentry .post-content, .single .hentry\r\n{border: 1px solid #00adee !important;}  \r\n  \r\n.site-branding, .main-navigation li\r\n{padding: 30px 10px 20px 10px !important;}  \r\n  \r\n.site-content\r\n{margin-top: 0px !important;}\r\n  \r\n#undefined-sticky-wrapper\r\n{height: 170px !important;}  \r\n  \r\n.home-wrapper\r\n{margin-top: -40px !important;}  \r\n  \r\n}"}
