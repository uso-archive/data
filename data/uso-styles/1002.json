Later i realised that i have to modify the code with the selector first-child and it worked.\r\nBasically the operator > it's useful for the parent structure but if there is many elements in cascade and u want to apply css code to the first element only, u have to include with first-child. If u want the nth element to be applied, i think that the selector is: nth-child(x) or something like that, I really haven't used yet.\r\n\r\nNote: Thanks Valacar for the code, really it works the same as mine, the purpose it was to hide the yellow box at top, i dont mind the line around. Really yr code is better because i dont hide all the table but the td element (that is inside the table). I am not a programmer and i am beggining with CSS language so excuses if i am wrong.","user":{"id":512,"name":"David R","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2006-09-21T15:44:12.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":384,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/1002_after.png?r=1587888283","url":"/styles/1002/website-cleaner-filmaffinity-com","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"filmaffinity.com\") {\r\n\r\n\r\nhtml>body>table:first-child>tbody>tr>td>table:first-child>tbody>tr>td  /* the hard thing*/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{display:none !important;}\r\n\r\n}"}
