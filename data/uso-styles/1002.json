{"id":1002,"name":"Website: cleaner - filmaffinity.com","description":"There is a top yellow box in this web that its annoying and i try to hide it using the xpath but it dindt succes cause the entire page it was erased. Later i realised that i have to modify the code with the selector first-child and it worked.\r\nBasically the operator \u003e it's useful for the parent structure but if there is many elements in cascade and u want to apply css code to the first element only, u have to include with first-child. If u want the nth element to be applied, i think that the selector is: nth-child(x) or something like that, I really haven't used yet.\r\n\r\nNote: Thanks Valacar for the code, really it works the same as mine, the purpose it was to hide the yellow box at top, i dont mind the line around. Really yr code is better because i dont hide all the table but the td element (that is inside the table). I am not a programmer and i am beggining with CSS language so excuses if i am wrong.","user":{"id":512,"name":"David R","email":"bartolome.ortega@hotmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"updated":"2006-09-21T15:44:12.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":402,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/1002_after.png?r=1685088013","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-09-21T15:44:12.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"filmaffinity","subcategory":"filmaffinity","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"filmaffinity.com\") {\r\n\r\n\r\nhtml\u003ebody\u003etable:first-child\u003etbody\u003etr\u003etd\u003etable:first-child\u003etbody\u003etr\u003etd  /* the hard thing*/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{display:none !important;}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/1002/website-cleaner-filmaffinity-com.user.js","style_settings":[]}
