{"id":37228,"name":"Flickr title above photo, expand photostream","description":"\u003cb\u003eLATEST VERSION: style 82074 \u003c/b\u003e\r\n\r\nIn June 2010, Flickr made some radical design changes to the photo page that were, on the whole, excellent. There were just a few things that bothered me, which I described here:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/fjordaan/4731650184/in/set-465611/ This stylesheet items 2 and 4 on my list:\r\n\r\n(1) Reinstate title above photo\r\n(2) Keep the 'photostream' film strip permanently open. (It's currently hidden when you come from a different context, such as Contacts or Favorites.)\r\n\r\nSee also my stylesheet for reinstating the button bar: style 37282\r\n\r\nReport any issues on the Flickr photo page or Flickr Hacks thread:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/fjordaan/5024220354/\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/groups/flickrhacks/discuss/72157625032814264/","user":{"id":63086,"name":"fjordaan","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://www.isotoma.com","about":"UX director at www.isotoma.com\r\nTweeting @fjordaan","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2010-09-27T02:48:26.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":423,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/37228_after.png?r=1674374413","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-09-23T14:34:00.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"flickr","subcategory":"flickr","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.flickr.com\") {\r\n/* MOVE TITLE ABOVE PHOTO */\r\nh1.photo-title {\r\nposition: absolute;\r\ntop: 36px;\r\nmax-width: 640px;\r\nbackground: #fff;\r\n}\r\nh1.photo-title:hover {\r\nbackground: transparent;\r\n}\r\nh1.photo-title.insitu-editing {\r\nz-index: 999;\r\n}\r\n#photo {\r\nmargin-top: 49px !important;\r\nmargin-bottom: 10px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* PERMANENTLY EXPAND PHOTOSTREAM FILM STRIP */\r\n.sidebar-context-first .context-photos {\r\ndisplay: block !important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/37228/flickr-title-above-photo-expand-photostream.user.js","style_settings":[]}
