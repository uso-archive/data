{"id":227553,"name":"Discord - Minimize/hide Channel + Friends sidebar","description":"This style shrinks the left sidebar (channels and friends) to 12px wide until you hover your cursor over it, which is when it expands to its full width.\r\n\r\nA 12px width will allow you to see the white indicator that shows that someone has sent a message in a channel, without taking up too much space.\r\n\r\nThis style should work for all future versions of Discord, and will also continue being maintained as I depend on it daily myself.\r\n\r\nThis style AVOIDS minimizing the sidebar in the settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso see my other styles for hiding \"Gift nitro\", \"Send stickers\", \"Send GIF\" and \"Send emojis\" buttons on the right hand side of the chatting input!","user":{"id":1363485,"name":"Vinter","email":"vinterborge@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2022-01-28T14:17:24.000Z","weekly_install_count":13,"total_install_count":594,"rating":5.0,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/227553_after.png?r=1687593692","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2022-01-26T13:15:57.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"discord","subcategory":"discord","additional_info":"28. jan 2022\r\nv0.2 - Updated so that CSS targets all elements that starts with the class \"sidebar\", EXCEPT for \"nav\"-elements.
