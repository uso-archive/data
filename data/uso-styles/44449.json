{"id":44449,"name":"Simple Scrollbars","description":"Based a lot on The Aeroboy Chrome extension (http://goo.gl/1fBKP), these scrollbars are a slight refinement. Choose between his and mine, I'm not sure how much better or worse mine are! WEBKIT BROWSERS ONLY (Chromium, Safari, ect. - NOT Firefox).\r\n\r\nNEW - Mozilla version: style 46044.\r\n\r\nDifferences to Aeroboy's extension:\r\n - Transparency on all scrollbars except the far outer ones.\r\n - Change of colour on hover and mouse down.\r\n - Thinner.\r\n - Possible other things I have forgotten.\r\n\r\nScreenshot notes:\r\n - Them two scrollbars in \"after\" really are the same colour, it's an optical illusion! Even I (who wrote the code) had to check this in Paint.\r\n - The scrollbar in \"before\" is from an XP theme I have downloaded (i.e. the system default).\r\n - The screenshots are from this page (the edit page), with style 44215 activated.","user":{"id":90468,"name":"m1n1f1g","email":"jammyatjammy@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"updated":"2011-04-10T02:58:20.000Z","weekly_install_count":5,"total_install_count":10188,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/44449_after.png?r=1687593612","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2011-02-21T09:58:15.000Z","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"additional_info":"Release history:\r\n1.0: What it started as.\r\n1.1: \"Overlays\" scrollbar onto background (rather than creating a white bar.\r\nFixed (sort of) problem with pages that do not have a background or body scrollbar.
