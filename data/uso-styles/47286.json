{"id":47286,"name":"Firefox  - Bookmark icon only hover selector","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","style_tags":[],"description":"A small code snippet to display bookmarks as 'icon only' on the bookmark toolbar. Icons \"light up\" when hovered.\r\n\r\nPlease check out http://userstyles.org/styles/48331/ff4-bookmark-quicktip?r=1306299620. Your bookmark information will display immediately upon hover!\r\n\r\nPurpose: The Firefox style I currently use consists of only two rows. One row is for session tabs and the other contains the navbar buttons, the bookmark toolbar, the urlbar (which doubles as the search bar), and the Win7 window controls. The overall theme is for transparency (which is not a requirement), function and smaller size. This snippet of code allows for a large number of bookmarks and a small amount of space usage, without losing any bookmark information. The code is simple and should be easily customizable with very little modification.\r\n\r\nCompare the first and second Stylish bookmark icons in the image to show the difference between the hovered and dimmed icons.
