{"id":60097,"name":"WriteRoom for Google Docs 2012","description":"Transforms the current version of the Google Docs writer into a minimalistic, dark screen to assist with creating a distraction-free writing environment. Makes the screen dark, inverts colours, and hides all the editor chrome. You can bring it all back up temporarily by just hovering your mouse near the top of the screen. Be sure to run with the browser in full-screen mode (F11 on Windows, Command+Shift+F on OS X)","user":{"id":122208,"name":"IanHead","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2012-10-22T18:52:32.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":2973,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/60097_after.jpeg?r=1687593612","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2012-01-29T19:09:56.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":"23/10/2012: No longer affects spreadsheets.\r\n24/04/2012: Reverted fade-in and out to old form because um... I can't make my mind up! Fixed the annoying 1px white line at the top of the screen. Tweaked scrollbars in Chrome slightly.\r\n11/04/2012: Scrollbars are now more visible in Chrome. Fade in and out for editor chrome now is a bit more subtle and doesn't mess up the menus.\r\n30/01/2012: Initial release.\r\n\r\nTze obligatory screenies:\r\n\r\nBefore \u003e http://i.imgur.com/NHWRO.png\r\nAfter \u003e  http://i.imgur.com/P0bIp.png\r\n\r\nTested in Firefox and Chrome.\r\n\r\nEnabling 'Compact Controls' will break them. Would be easy to fix but I can't be bothered.\r\n\r\nTons of other bugs and I'll probably never update this unless I come across problems that bother me as I'm using it.
