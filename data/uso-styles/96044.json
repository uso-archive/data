This only happens if it's on an odd line, since the list is striped. As the selected line background color was the same, you could lose track of which one you were selecting, except by moving again, of course.\r\n\r\nI also fixed the currently \u003cb\u003efocused\u003c/b\u003e message highlighting. This is different from selection. If you use the keyboard a lot, like me, sometimes you have some messages selected and wants to select another that is not contiguous (by using the Ctrl key to move the focused line). This was completeley disappeared in my TB with TT DeepDark and I changed it in order to get it back.\r\n\r\nAnyway, design and Thunderbird CSS is not my specialty. Any suggestions are always welcome!\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e(I also hope that Steva, author for TT DeepDark, does not get upset with my proposed changes - I guess viewing can change a lot from some displays to others, don't know if it was my case)\u003c/i\u003e","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(\"http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul\");\r\n\r\ntreechildren::-moz-tree-row(selected) {\r\n  background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(255,255,255,.15), rgba(255,255,255,.15)) !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntreechildren::-moz-tree-row(current, focus) {\r\n  border: 1px dotted blue !important;\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":39424,"name":"Nice catch","rating":3,"created":"2013-12-13T05:26:13.000Z","author_name":"To6","author_id":251306}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
