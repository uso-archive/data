{"id":71409,"name":"Facebook - HideFriendsBoxes","description":"This style is meant to help you forget those nasty people (so called \"friends\") that did you wrong but that you can not - you may have your reasons - unfriend or block. It simply vanishes the two friend-list boxes right under your cover and also in your timeline.\r\n\r\nNOTE: the screenshots were tampered with because of privacy issues. I don't want my friends to get mad at me because they got posted on some site without explicit consent.\r\nFAIR WARNING: this will also hide your friend's boxes (the one you should see on their pages. In order to avoid this, you should change the target URL to include YOUR PAGE ONLY).","user":{"id":154516,"name":"Acsel","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2012-08-18T01:26:11.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":205,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/71409_after.jpeg?r=1684396854","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2012-08-18T01:04:34.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"facebook","subcategory":"facebook","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(facebook.com) {\r\n\r\nli#pagelet_timeline_friends_nav_top.friends.tile.firstTab{\r\n\r\nbackground: black;\r\nopacity: 0.0;}\r\n\r\nli#tl_unit_134443406686720_recent.fbTimelineUnit.fbTimelineTwoColumn.clearfix {\r\n\r\nbackground: black;\r\nopacity: 0.0}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/71409/facebook-hidefriendsboxes.user.js","style_settings":[]}
