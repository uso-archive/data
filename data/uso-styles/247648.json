(Which also prevents purple screens during ad timer.)\r\n\r\nEssentially you'll end up with a Bet+Chat Window and a Stream Window. I fill a monitor with these two windows.\r\n\r\nThis is a really dumb and simple style intended for just me but given the nature of the site I figured I'd at least add these notes.","user":{"id":2869944,"name":"Jon M","email":"jonmmooon@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2022-08-02T12:03:21.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":21,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/247648_after.png?r=1682841616","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"arr","created":"2022-08-02T07:29:46.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"saltybet","subcategory":"saltybet","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(saltybet.com) {\r\n#video-embed\r\n{display: none;width:0%;height:0%;}\r\n#chat-wrapper\r\n{width:50%;height:70%;}\r\n#sbettorswrapper\r\n{width:50%;height:70%;font-size:18px;}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/247648/saltybet-com-narrow-for-portrait-view.user.js","style_settings":[]}
