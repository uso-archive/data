{"id":19676,"name":"Google Analytics - Show longer pagenames hack","description":"On the page under https://www.google.com/analytics/reporting/top_content shows a longer table than in the original GA-design, so you can read on first sight most URLs and don't have to guess.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n- Cannot give the moz-document url space, since the GA interface URL (ID) is different for every user. So it may(!) apply for more pages on the web.\r\n- Distorts the rest of the design a little bit.\r\n- Has impact on Wikipedia and GMX too, sadly. They use the same div-names. Just deactivate the style, when not using GA.","user":{"id":5174,"name":"lestarte2008","email":"me@lestarte.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2009-07-21T13:48:49.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":318,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/19676_after.gif?r=1673683213","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-07-21T13:48:49.000Z","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n/* (c) 2009 by Lestarte */\r\n\r\nobject[data*=\"content\"],\r\n\r\ntd [class=\"text\"], div [class=\"text_wrapper\"], a {\r\n  width:500px !important;\r\n  overflow:visible;\r\n}\r\n","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/19676/google-analytics-show-longer-pagenames-hack.user.js","style_settings":[]}
