{"id":26639,"name":"Torn City: Hide upgrade links for level sitters","description":"Hey level sitters! Wanna hide those pesky 'upgrade to the next level' links so you don't accidentally click them? Then this short style is for you!\r\n\r\n*** IMPORTANT: If you use the TC Superpack (with Greasemonkey) go to \"Superpack Config\" in the left hand menu and DISABLE \"Upgrading level\" in \"confirming config\" section. As the superpack changes the URL on the homepage (for notification of level upgrade) the homepage link will NOT be hidden if you have this Superpack option set. The [Upgrade] link next to your level will be hidden as long as you have this script on, regardless of any superpack preferences.","user":{"id":21321,"name":"Sanitarium","email":"rach.coloured.blue@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2010-03-24T20:15:57.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1074,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/26639_after.png?r=1684051213","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-03-24T20:15:57.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"www.torn","subcategory":"www.torn","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http://www.torn) {\r\n\r\nA[title=\"Go up a level!\"],\r\nA[href^=\"level\"]\r\n\r\n{display: none !important;}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/26639/torn-city-hide-upgrade-links-for-level-sitters.user.js","style_settings":[]}
