And again!\r\n\r\nImage credit for the castle goes to jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaackson.tumblr.com !\r\n\r\n0.1?\r\nMade the code look tidier (I know right)\r\nMoved the number to actually sit not-on-top of the castle. Don't want to move it up to keep it in line with the rest of the site.\r\n\r\n0.2?\r\nRaised the castle a bit to be in-line with the circular tumblr icons (gear and ?). Feels better, I think\r\n\r\n0.3?\r\nTiny fix, changed the castle icon for the one supplied by the actual author!\r\n\r\n0.4?\r\nAnother tiny fix. Nudged the castle 8 pixels to the left so there'd be roughly the same distance between all icons. I KNOW RIGHT?\r\n\r\n0.5?\r\nNudged it by one pixel. Also fixed some open brackets.\r\n\r\n0.6?\r\nCode variation by Ohne Mitleid. Made some adjustments because reasons. Sorry bro\r\nIf this ends up causing more bad than good let me know and I'll put the old code back even though it's not exactly effective\r\nfingers crossed","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix('http://www.tumblr.com/'), url-prefix('https://www.tumblr.com/')   {\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#home_button.tab.iconic \u003e a {\r\n  width: 9px !important;\r\n  height: 37px !important;\r\n  background-image: url(\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ma1reyTFJb1qefa3ho1_100.png\") !important;\r\n  background-size: 44px 37px !important;\r\n  margin-left: 7px !important;\r\n  margin-top: -9px !important;\r\n  padding-left: 44px !important;\r\n  padding-top: 9px !important;\r\n  opacity: .65 !important;\r\n}\r\n#home_button.tab.iconic \u003e a:hover {\r\n  opacity: .75 !important;\r\n}\r\n#home_button.tab.iconic.selected \u003e a,\r\n#home_button.tab.iconic.selected \u003e a:hover  {\r\n  opacity: 1 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* peasants?   */\r\n#home_button .tab_notice {\r\n    left: 63px !important;\r\n    right: auto !important;\r\n}\r\n \r\n    \r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/72365/who-s-the-peasant-now-tumblr.user.js","style_settings":[]}
