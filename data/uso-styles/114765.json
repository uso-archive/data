After noticing that many of the sites I use regularly didn't have any dark styles (or any styles at all for that matter), I decided to upload my own for any other sufferers (or just anyone else who likes a darker look) to use. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am in no way an expert. I am aware that most of my styles are far from perfect, but they work for what I use them for. I learned a lot of what I know from just looking at other people's styles I've used in the past; as such, everyone is welcome to make whatever changes are needed to my styles to suit their own usage/tastes (if you need help, just ask).\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has contributed to this great utility, and eternal thanks to Stylish for being exactly what lets me enjoy the web!\r\n\r\nPS. I use the FT DeepDark theme and styles for Firefox by Steva/Sr21, so my dark color scheme is similar to that (although I make mine a touch darker). If you want different colors, everything should be easily changeable.","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-08-09T14:57:58.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":539,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/114765_after.png?r=1589357004","url":"/styles/114765/tumblr-korean-text-dash-icons-nova","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document url(\"http://www.tumblr.com/\"), url-prefix(\"http://www.tumblr.com/\"), url-prefix(\"https://www.tumblr.com/\") {\r\n\r\n/*Style by Novadestin, translations by yuu-jin.*/\r\n\r\na.new_post_label > i \r\n{height: 90px;margin-top:-5px;}\r\n\r\n.new_post_label/*_icon*/ > I \r\n{background: url('http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v24/novadestin/koreaniconoswhite.png') no-repeat !important; z-index: -1;}\r\n\r\n.new_post_label > I \r\n{color: transparent !important; transition: background-position .08s linear !important;}\r\n\r\n#new_post_label_text > I {background-position: 2px -5px !important;}\r\n#new_post_label_photo > I {background-position: -73px -5px !important;}\r\n#new_post_label_quote > I {background-position: -146px -5px !important;}\r\n#new_post_label_link > I {background-position: -220px -5px  !important;}\r\n#new_post_label_chat > I {background-position: -297px -5px !important;}\r\n#new_post_label_audio > I {background-position: -373px -5px  !important;}\r\n#new_post_label_video > I {background-position: -450px -5px  !important;}\r\n\r\n.post.post_full  \r\n{background-color:#181818 !important;}\r\n\r\n}"}
