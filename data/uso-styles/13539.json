This operation is to be made only once after loading the style into Stylish. However, after rebooting the browser, everything works correctly.\r\nWho wants on the contrary to prevent the name of the search engine to overrun the space of the go button have to install my style 13543 and set opacity to zero.","user":{"id":5335,"name":"Matteo Palmieri","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-01-06T01:10:40.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":389,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/13539_after.png?r=1573113671","url":"/styles/13539/search-bar-go-button-show-when-typing-only","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n#searchbar .searchbar-box:not(focused), #searchbar .searchbar-textbox:not(focused) .search-go-button\r\n{\r\n  display: none !important; \r\n}\r\n\r\n#searchbar .searchbar-box[focused=\"true\"], #searchbar .searchbar-textbox[focused=\"true\"] .search-go-button\r\n{\r\n  display: block !important; \r\n}"}
