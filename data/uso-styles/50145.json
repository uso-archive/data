My work and play cross paths often since I get a lot of joy out of what I do and study, some of which are:\r\n\r\n- Perl + CPAN Developer\r\n- Linux C++ Developer (Qt4, Qt5, KDE4, KFM5, and related)\r\n- Shell Script Developer (Perl, BASH, sh, upstart, vim plugin development)\r\n- Web Style Developer (CSS, SaSS, SGML, HTML5, etc) though I do know HTML4 too [who doesn't?]\r\n- Windows C++ Developer (Old Pro in Microsoft related technologies)\r\n- Old-School Technologies (qbasic, vbdos, borland c++, ms-dos 6.66, i386 assembler /w emphasis on _some_ 64-bit stuff)\r\n- Music Hobbyist (Electronic Music Writer, Piano, Keyboard player/Enthusiast)\r\n- Graphic Artist (Pencil/Pen/Watercolor physical media, Maya/Blender/3DSMax/Bryce/Gimp/Photoshop HD and post-production)\r\n\r\nI am not currently in any group at the time. I am not sure if I will be doing that ever again. The last few groups I participated in were too incoherent and seemed to have different ideals, ethics, goals. \r\n\r\nI am open to suggestion or requests, just don't make them impossible for a single person to do. Requesting a theme have a black version is probably okay. Requesting that I personally show up and restyle your entire website is probably not. Of course, if I were getting paid to do it, that would be a whole other matter, but I rarely see people paying for such things these days when you can hire someone in another country to do it for 2 cents -- that's right I'm a bitter man :D= \u003c- those are vampire teeth!!","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2015-04-27T15:03:13.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":734,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/50145-after.png?r=1685865614","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"publicdomain","created":"2011-07-01T21:10:14.000Z","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"additional_info":"Current Version: initial release, lets call it version 1.0\r\n  Written by Gabriel Sharp (osirisgothra@hotmail.com)\r\n  Updated 7/3/2011 11:06pm\r\n  Imported CSS' From: Scratch, and from other anonymous styles that i have seen, clipped via firebug\r\n \r\n  domain(s): global (all domains)\r\n    removes: inline frames, tags that have commonly used ad-ware/spyware signatures or attributes\r\n       adds: extra area to your webpages\r\n      notes: intended to be used *most* of the time.
