The only time a transition delay is used is when the control bar hides, but that was probably left over by accident from an earlier version of the CSS. This ends up being a significant problem when closed captions are enabled, because once the seek bar enters \"mini mode\", the captions are hidden behind the control bar for 3 seconds. This style simply removes the delay, fixing the issue.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document regexp(\"https?://mediaplayer.pearsoncmg.com/assets/\\\\S*\"), regexp(\"https?://www.mathxl.com/Student/MediaPopup.aspx\\\\S*\")\r\n  {\r\n  \r\n  .pvp-controls-hide {\r\n    transition-delay: unset;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/138518/caption-fix-for-video-on-pearson-sites.user.js","style_settings":[]}
