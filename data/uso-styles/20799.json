{"id":20799,"name":"extbook - autohide bookmark stars","description":"Autohide the additional stars of add-on \"extbook\" (https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/10567) and recover by hovering the urlbar. I think that if you set up the stars once, you don't usually need to show the addstar-button, so I hide it. If you want it back, just comment out the appropriate lines.\r\nThere is one bug in my code: If you click the \"old\" star to edit your bookmark, the dialog window jumps somewhere. I don't know how to fix it. But if you use the library to edit, you shouldn't worry.\r\n\r\nHey, and watch my nice APNG-image ;-)\r\n\r\nIf you don't want the feed-button to jump around, add \"#feed-button {-moz-box-ordinal-group: 2 !important;}\".
