This made it very difficult to override the CSS. However, I was able to expand the card height so that it used some of the margin between the cards. The cards are much closer together now, but I think it's worth it for the multi-line titles.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I can't add any more lines to the title without having access to the JavaScript source code.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://airtable.com/\") {\r\n.kanbanCardContainer .baymaxGalleryCard \u003e div[style] {\r\n  height: auto !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.kanbanCardContainer .baymaxGalleryCard \u003e div \u003e .flex.items-center[style] {\r\n  height: auto !important;\r\n  max-height: 50px;\r\n  align-items: flex-start;\r\n  overflow: hidden;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.kanbanCardContainer .baymaxGalleryCard \u003e div \u003e .flex.items-center \u003e div {\r\n  font-size: 0.9em;\r\n  white-space: normal;\r\n\r\n  /*\r\n    Multi-line truncation, only works in Chrome\r\n    See: http://hackingui.com/front-end/a-pure-css-solution-for-multiline-text-truncation/\r\n  */\r\n  -webkit-line-clamp: 2;\r\n  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;\r\n  display: -webkit-box;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/167471/airtable-better-kanban-titles.user.js","style_settings":[]}
