Reduces the newly increased font size and makes them underlined.\r\n\r\nA very simple attempt at making hyperlinks in search results look more like classic links.  Some special search features might not be formatted quite right.  The regular expression should match most/all of the Google country domains.\r\n\r\nUpdate June 2015: Change domain regex to try and include more, such as country (co.uk) domains.\r\n\r\nUpdate July 2015: Google changed results from &lt;li> to &lt;div> elements (which is weird, since they're still in a parent &lt;ol>...).\r\n\r\nUpdate Sept 2018: Updated to support changes to search result HTML (&lt;h3> was moved inside the &lt;a> tag).",
