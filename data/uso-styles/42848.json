Firefox itself should prevent you from accessing such sites identified by  stopbadware.org as both Mozilla, Google,  and several others are partners.\r\n\r\nThe highlighting will help you avoid clicking on the site.\r\n\r\nEven though Firefox uses the same data, there will be timing differences between what is available from Google servers and what Mozilla has downloaded to you for your protection.",
