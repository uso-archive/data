{"id":9628,"name":"Kotaku Skin - DDN-Tan (+cleaner)","description":"ｷﾀ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━(ﾟ∀ﾟ)━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━!!\r\n\r\nNOT CLEAN ANYMORE, Kotaku changed their code already\r\n\r\nv1.0\r\n\r\nIt's like I'm really on Dark Diamond!\r\n\r\nDark Diamond is an up-and-coming blog bringing you video game, anime, and general otaku news at http://darkdiamond.net/. This Kotaku skin and cleaner shows off our mascot and makes use of our distinctive purple and black color scheme.\r\n\r\nThis is pretty much a joke style, but it does clean up Kotaku massively and leaves very little left but the stories, the pictures, and DDN-Tan. Even some navigation is missing. The simple style is suited to those who frequently read the site via RSS rather than comment. Features:\r\n\r\n(☞ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞\r\n\r\n-Dark Diamond color scheme\r\n-DDN-Tan cheerfully staying by your side through every news story\r\n-Links are yellow on mouseover\r\n-No sidebar\r\n-No logos\r\n-No ads\r\n-No author information\r\n-No \"more\" or \"back\" navigation\r\n-No comments\r\n-No post separators\r\n-Final Destination\r\n\r\nm9(・∀・)\r\n\r\n-IMPORTANT: host the background picture somewhere else! So go to this url: http://i34.tinypic.com/2l9iayq.png, save it, and replace it in this line of text:\r\n\u003ebackground-image:url('http://i34.tinypic.com/2l9iayq.png')\r\n\r\n( ゜▽゜)=◯)`ν゜)\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\n-Couldn't get rid of italics in article titles\r\n-Couldn't get rid of border colors for images\r\n-Extremely limited navigation\r\n-I probably won't fix this much, but if you like it maybe I will\r\n\r\nPlease provide feedback, lemme know what you think.\r\n\r\nｷﾀ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━(ﾟ∀ﾟ)━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━!!\r\n\r\nAbout me and my styles, and how to get me to make more of them:\r\n\r\nI update my styles a lot because I often make stupid little mistakes AND I like to tweak stuff to death, so make sure you always have the most current versions of the styles. I will note a few important changes in the description. \r\n\r\nThanks for the big number of installs on the Konata skin! I am truly flattered. Because of this response, trust me, I will continue to make more skins in the future. In fact, if you drop me a line I will even take commissions. At this point, my proposed prices are 10 bux for a 4chan skin and 20 bux for other websites. This is because I have more knowledge of the 4chan CSS and am not yet a full-fledged CSS wizard, so each new site will have a bit of a learning curve for me. Also in general there are still several things I don't know how to do, but I could easily make some skins even more involved than my current ones with a little bit of research. \r\n\r\nCOMMISSIONS IN SUMMARY:\r\n\r\n-$10 for 4chan skins and $20 for other sites. If the skin is pitifully simple I'll drop it to $5\r\n-Talk to me at kifte_arcane@hotmail.com or quiche on Rizon\r\n-Tell me what you want and I will try my best to deliver\r\n-I will work closely with you and you'll see beta screens\r\n-Skins could take up to a week to complete\r\n-If I fail at making the skin for some reason, you don't pay\r\n-Payment is expected once I tell you a skin has been completed and show final screens\r\n\r\nAlso, random acts of donation are highly appreciated. WHY DON'T YOU PAY ME A LOT, FOREVER?\r\n\r\nps darkchan style sux","user":{"id":13209,"name":"Quiche","email":"kifte_arcane@hotmail.com","paypal_email":"kifte_arcane@hotmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-08-13T03:14:51.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":560,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/9628_after.gif?r=1687593612","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-08-13T03:14:51.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"kotaku","subcategory":"kotaku","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"kotaku.com\")\r\n\r\n{\r\n* {\r\nfont-family:\"Tahoma\", sans-serif !important;\r\nleft:20px !important;\r\ncolor:rgb(255,255,255) !important;\r\n-moz-appearance: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nhtml,body {\r\nfont-size:14px !important;\r\nbackground-color:rgb(0,0,0) !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#header\r\n  {display:none !important;background-image:none !important;text-decoration:none !important; font-weight:normal !important;color:white !important;\r\n}\r\n#header_container\r\n  {display:none !important;background-image:none !important;text-decoration:none !important; font-weight:normal !important;color:white !important;\r\n}\r\n#sidebar\r\n  {display:none !important;background-image:none !important;\r\n}\r\n.page_navigation\r\n{display:none !important;\r\n}\r\n#postMeta\r\n{display:none !important;\r\n}\r\n#post-supplement\r\n{display:none !important;\r\n}\r\n#container\r\n  {left:10px !important;background-image:none !important;text-decoration:none !important; font-weight:normal !important;color:white !important;background-color:rgb(100,0,130) !important;\r\nopacity:100 !important;\r\n-moz-border-radius:40px !important;\r\npadding-bottom:40px !important;\r\n}\r\n#content_container\r\n  {top:10px!important;left:0px !important;background-image:none !important;text-decoration:none !important; font-weight:normal !important;color:white !important;\r\n-moz-border-radius:70px !important;\r\nbackground-color:rgb(100,0,130) !important;\r\nbackground-image:url('http://i34.tinypic.com/2l9iayq.png') !important;\r\nbackground-position: 865px 200px !important;\r\nbackground-repeat:no-repeat !important;\r\nbackground-attachment:fixed !important;\r\n}\r\n#main\r\n  {position:relative!important;\r\n   top:20px!important;background-image:none !important;text-decoration:none !important; font-weight:normal !important;color:white !important;\r\n}\r\n.metadata\r\n {display:none !important;\r\n}\r\n#tead\r\n  {display:none !important;background-image:none !important\r\n}\r\nblockquote\r\n  {background-color:black !important;left:200px !important;\r\n}\r\ntable\r\n  {background-color:black !important;left:200px !important;\r\n}\r\n#footer\r\n  {display:none !important;\r\n}\r\n#dfpad\r\n  {display:none !important;\r\n}\r\n#comments\r\n {display:none !important;\r\n}\r\n.separator\r\n{display:none !important;\r\n}\r\na{text-decoration:underline !important; font-weight:normal !important;color:white !important;}\r\n\r\n#img{\r\nbackground:transparent !important;\r\nborder:solid 3px rgb(100,0,130) !important;\r\n-moz-border-radius:10px !important;\r\nopacity:100 !important;\r\nz-index:3 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\na.quotejs:hover, a:hover{color:rgb(240,220,150) !important;}\r\n\r\n}\r\n","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/9628/kotaku-skin-ddn-tan-cleaner.user.js","style_settings":[]}
