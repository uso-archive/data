{"id":43839,"name":"Gawker 2011 - Vintage Gawker (Removed Sidebar)","description":"Like many of you, I despise change, and the new Gawker layouts have change all over the place. So I took it upon myself to make the new Gawker look as much like the old Gawker as possible. I whipped this up in a few hours and it may be prone to quite a few errors. Once this style is applied, I actually like it better than old Gawker. There's probably a cleaner way to accomplish everything that I did, but I'm no web designer. I'm just a college student who reads a lot of lifehacker and kotaku.\r\n\r\nUpon installing this style, click the newspaper icon at the top right of whatever Gawker site you're viewing to be directed to the blog.*******.com equivalent of the site, as that is the version of the site that this style is coded for.\r\n\r\nThis style is actively updated, so if you encounter any bugs, feel free to comment and I'll try to fix it.","user":{"id":7232,"name":"tsunami643","email":"samsroafen@mailinator.com","paypal_email":"neal410@yahoo.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2012-04-11T07:32:44.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":2374,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/43839_after.jpeg?r=1687593612","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2011-02-07T12:53:04.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"kotaku","subcategory":"kotaku","additional_info":"Update 4/10/12 - Minor change to gallery view that fixes the weird stretching. I don't really visit any more gawker sites, so sorry that this may have taken a long time to fix.\r\n\r\nUpdate 7/29/11 - Another day, another redesign. Gawker 2.0 v3 has now been rolled out across the board and after some tinkering, this style is now fully updated again to make it not look like terribad. I suppose this redesign was a good thing, because I have now taken the time to properly center the site. There is likely quite a bit of deprecated code in this style by now, but I'm too lazy to pick it out. If you take the time to optimize this style, feel free to let me know.\r\n\r\nUpdate 7/13/11 - Looks like Lifehacker is once again a guinea pig for yet another redesign of the redesign of the redesign. Make up your mind about how you want your crappy site to look, Denton, so I can stop having to update this style. Lifehacker still looks a little silly with this style. This is because I don't want to have to fully support both Gawker layouts at the same time. Once this new new new version rolls out across the board, I'll do some cleaning up.\r\n\r\nUpdate 5/27/11 - Minor cleanup in gallery view. Fixed profile view.\r\n\r\nUpdate 5/15/11 - Fixed minor syntax error that stopped this style from working in Firefox. Also removes minor graphical error in login/username box.\r\n\r\nUpdate 5/10/11 - The newer template that only Lifehacker was using initially has been rolled out to all the Gawker sites. At first I was happy and thought that this style was now obsolete, but apparently viewing articles on the newer template brings back the sidebar. Fortunately, nothing in this style was broken by the new template (yet), so the code has not been updated since the May 7th update. Also, presence control and search functionality is back.\r\n\r\nUpdate 5/7/11 - Fixed replies being cut off on the newer version of the Gawker template that Lifehacker is using.\r\n\r\nUpdate 4/5/11 - I apparently uploaded an older version of the style on April 1st and just now realized my mistake. I promise that everything should look as it does in the screenshot now and most everything has been fixed.\r\n\r\nUpdate 4/1/11 - I got extremely annoyed with the fact that all Gawker sites would bring my internet to a crawl and it turns out it was because Gawker sucks at site coding. Now the sidebar is hidden in a different way so your internet won't get massacred on a gawker site. Also, I've readjusted the widths of stuff. On the bright side, galleries are now a million times more viewable.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2/23/11 - Now gets rid of the stupid flash ads that plays over the first news story for like ten seconds.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2/12/11 - Whoops, accidentally got rid of the Reply and Promote buttons, this has been corrected.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2/11/11 - Login functionality is back, however after spending an inordinate amount of time trying to get search back, I eventually realized that the search results display in the sidebar. So if you ever want to use search, disable this style, I suppose.","style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n\r\n * Gawker 2011 - Vintage Gawker (Removed Sidebar)\r\n\r\n *\r\n\r\n * Author      : tsunami643\r\n\r\n * Updated     : April 10, 2012\r\n\r\n * Description : Removes sidebar, widens what's left\r\n\r\n */\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"kotaku.com\"), \r\n\r\ndomain(\"deadspin.com\"), \r\n\r\ndomain(\"lifehacker.com\"),\r\n\r\ndomain(\"jezebel.com\"), \r\n\r\ndomain(\"gizmodo.com\"), \r\n\r\ndomain(\"io9.com\"), \r\n\r\ndomain(\"jalopnik.com\"), \r\n\r\ndomain(\"gawker.com\"),\r\n\r\ndomain(\"fleshbot.com\")\r\n\r\n{\r\n/*REMOVING THE SIDEBAR*/\r\n#rightcontainer.cn_pager, #rightcontainer.ad_container, #rightbarSpinnerOverlay, #rightbarspinner, #right300spinner, #hoveringNextPostContainer, #gallery_transition_overlay, #fb_300x250, .cn_title, .sponsored_splash_post, .ad_marquee, .ad_chartbeat_end, a.tool.home, a.tool.popular, a.tool.search, #date-nav, #postTransitionOverlay, #post_list, #rightbar, #fbSiteLike, .icon.comment, #interstitial_bottom {display: none!important;}\r\n\r\n#rightcontainer {right: -1000px!important;}\r\n\r\n#rightbar_notification_container.inner {border-right: 0px solid #BBB!important;}\r\n\r\n\r\n/*FIXING COMMENTS AND ARTICLE VIEW*/\r\n.inner {width: 970px!important; padding-left: 10px!important; border-right: 1px solid #BBB!important; border-left: 1px solid #BBB!important;}\r\n\r\n.gmgrid,\r\n#classic_pager,\r\n.ctext.clearfix,\r\n.header,\r\n.threadfooter,\r\n.grid-full,\r\n#comments\r\n{width: 960px!important;}\r\n\r\n.comment, #thread_navigation, #container {width: 960px!important;}\r\n\r\n.topchrome {width: 960px!important;}\r\n\r\n.thread,\r\n.replies {width: 960px!important;}\r\n\r\n.permalink .post-body.quickpost{width: 970px!important; min-height: 100px!important;}\r\n\r\n.withpic .col-excerpt {width: 614px !important;}\r\n\r\n.threadnav,\r\n.thread_comments,\r\n.comment.cid {width: 953px!important;}\r\n.imgwrap.abovewrap {margin: -2px 0 13px 150px!important;}\r\n\r\n#profile, .sitescontainer {width: 960px!important;}\r\n\r\n/*FIXING GALLERY VIEW*/\r\n.grid-bleed {margin-top: 2px!important;}\r\n#thumb_list_window {width: 920px!important;}\r\n#thumb_navigation {width: 964px!important;}\r\n#gallery_container {width: 960px!important; height: 539px!important;}\r\n.gallery_image {width: 960px !important; height: 539px!important;}\r\n#gallery_container img, #gallery_video_container_2 object\r\n{max-width: 960px !important; width: 960px !important; height: 539px !important; max-height: 539px !important; margin: auto !important;}\r\n.permalink .lyteboxContainer .lyteboxLink a {text-indent: -139em!important;}\r\n.permalink #gallery_container .lyteboxLink {bottom: 3px!important;}\r\n\r\n/*REMOVING SISTER SITE LINKS*/\r\n#sitetags {display:none !important;}\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":25005,"name":"Re: Speed Boost","rating":0,"created":"2011-02-08T19:00:34.000Z","author_name":"ssokolow","author_id":17680},{"id":26033,"name":"Article Width","rating":0,"created":"2011-04-04T23:04:45.000Z","author_name":"war59312","author_id":3165},{"id":26647,"name":"Comments Now Broken - Text Is Not Being Confined Correctly","rating":3,"created":"2011-05-05T22:07:34.000Z","author_name":"war59312","author_id":3165},{"id":26817,"name":"Not working on kotaku.com","rating":0,"created":"2011-05-13T15:26:22.000Z","author_name":"war59312","author_id":3165},{"id":31615,"name":"6/25/2012 Comment change","rating":2,"created":"2012-06-28T11:19:58.000Z","author_name":"GoughGhan","author_id":147908}],"discussionsCount":5,"commentsCount":11,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/43839/gawker-2011-vintage-gawker-removed-sidebar.user.js","style_settings":[]}
