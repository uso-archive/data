{"id":126743,"name":"Reddit's up/downvote arrows for Voat","description":"Remember those upvote/downvote arrows on reddit? Perhaps you'd like to see them on Voat as well, right? Well, this Userstyle does just that for you. \r\n\r\nThis changes the usual Blue and Purple triangle upvoat/downvoat buttons into the reddit arrows respectively. Just keep in note that this does not userstyle doesn't work everywhere, and some subverses that have their own custom voting arrows might not allow this userstlye to work.\r\n\r\nThis also changes the color of (+|-) to look like the one from reddit, just like another userstyle I made. If you want just those colors, go to:\r\nhttps://userstyles.org/styles/126100/reddit-s-classic-colors-for-both-voat-and-reddit\r\n\r\nThis userstyle DOES NOT LOOK GOOD with darkmode.\r\n\r\nThis will not work out of the box with tampermonkey, so make your own edits to fit your needs.","user":{"id":305285,"name":"VCX","email":"playboxwii2@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2016-04-14T17:48:01.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":107,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/126743_after.png?r=1675238412","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/126743_additional_19591.png?r=1675238412"],"license":"publicdomain","created":"2016-04-14T17:48:01.000Z","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"additional_info":"v1: No updates as you're reading this.","style_tags":[],"css":"/* i really want this to be global */\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/*Spritesheet*/\r\n\r\n.arrow-downvote,\r\n.arrow-downvoted,\r\n.arrow-upvote,\r\n.arrow-upvoted,\r\n.comment .arrow-downvote,\r\n.comment .arrow-downvoted,\r\n.comment .arrow-upvote,\r\n.comment .arrow-upvoted,\r\n#manage,\r\n#mail.nohavemail,\r\n#mail.havemail {\r\n    background-image: url(http://i.imgur.com/PnOxT0k.png);\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/*Misc Styling*/\r\n\r\n.score.likes {\r\n    color: #FF8B60 !important\r\n}\r\n.score.dislikes {\r\n    color: #9494FF !important\r\n}\r\n.scorebar-likes {\r\n    background: #FF8B60\r\n}\r\n.scorebar-dislikes {\r\n    background: #9494FF\r\n}\r\n.rss-icon {\r\n    display: none\r\n}\r\na:visited {\r\n    color: #551a8b\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*Comments*/\r\n\r\n.author.submitter {\r\n    background: blue;\r\n    color: white !important\r\n}\r\na.submitter {\r\n    color: blue\r\n}\r\n.tagline .post_upvotes {\r\n    color: #FF8B60\r\n}\r\n.titlebox h1 a:hover {\r\n    color: black;\r\n    text-decoration: underline\r\n}\r\n.titlebox .bottom {\r\n    border-top: 1px solid black\r\n}\r\n.alert-h1 {\r\n    color: gray\r\n}\r\n.sidecontentbox .content {\r\n    border: 1px solid gray\r\n}\r\n/*Sign-in*/\r\n\r\n#loginForm .form-horizontal {\r\n    background: white;\r\n    border: 0px\r\n}\r\n.modal-title {\r\n    color: #4270a2\r\n}\r\n.modal-header {\r\n    background: white;\r\n    border: 0px\r\n}\r\n#loginForm .form-control {\r\n    width: 340px;\r\n    border-top: 1px grey\r\n}\r\n.modal-body .btn-whoaverse {\r\n    background: #4f86b5;\r\n    border-bottom: 2px solid #4270a2;\r\n    color: #ffffff;\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/126743/reddit-s-up-downvote-arrows-for-voat.user.js","style_settings":[]}
