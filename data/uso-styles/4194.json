I fixed it to look normal. \r\n          You can edit how much you want it fullscreen (I have it at 95% since i have a widescreen and i just wanted myspace to look better), but i think you have to make the other % lower so they add to 100%. \r\n        I want to add that i really didnt no what I was doing but this style is very nice (at least to me anyways).. It only makes it full screen and keeps the content intact so it still feels like myspace. I hope this helps people because I know it is alot better for me.","user":{"id":4956,"name":"drflux","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2007-11-20T19:44:55.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1377,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/4194-after.png?r=1587283394","url":"/styles/4194/myspace-full-screen-fixed-works-with-new-skin","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(myspace.com) {\r\n\ttd#westGutter, td#eastGutter{width:5% !important;}\r\n\t form, div#wrap, table#MainTable, col.col2, td#mainGutter, div#SplashContentWrap{width:95% !important; text-align: center;}\r\n}"}
