Also fixed the inline \"code\" element which had a white background and was unreadable.","user":{"id":50239,"name":"cecilkorik","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-06-17T08:03:09.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":702,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/30211-after.png?r=1591689941","url":"/styles/30211/skyy-s-dark-wikipedia-may2010-white-header-fix","discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"wikipedia.org\") {\r\n\r\n\r\nbody { background-color: #050505 !important; }\r\n#head { background-color: #050505 !important; }\r\n#mw-head { background-color: #050505 !important; }\r\n#mw-panel { background-color: #050505 !important; }\r\ncode { background-color: #225 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs li a, div.vectorTabs li a span { color: #888 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs li.selected a, div.vectorTabs li.selected a span { color: #88f !important; background-color: #222 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs ul li { background-image: none !important; background-color: #111 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs li a { background-image: none !important; border-right: 1px solid #666 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs { background-image: none !important; border-left: 1px solid #666 !important; }\r\n\r\n}"}
