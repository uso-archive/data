{"id":30211,"name":"SKYY's Dark Wikipedia (May2010 white header fix)","description":"Just a little hack-fix to style 28563 *OR* style 4955 both by user 635 Hopefully the original author will come out with an official (and prettier!) fix soon, but until then I can't stand looking at the glaring white, so this kills it and fixes the tabs up a bit as well.\r\n\r\nI've tested it with the non-rounded version, but don't see why it wouldn't work with the rounded version as well.\r\n\r\nYou must have the SKYY's style for this to work, this is just an addon!\r\n\r\nUpdate 2010-06-17: Fixed some more white areas that recently appeared in the header and left sidebar. Also fixed the inline \"code\" element which had a white background and was unreadable.","user":{"id":50239,"name":"cecilkorik","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2010-06-17T08:03:09.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":727,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/30211-after.png?r=1683187213","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-05-15T16:33:33.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"wikipedia","subcategory":"wikipedia","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"wikipedia.org\") {\r\n\r\n\r\nbody { background-color: #050505 !important; }\r\n#head { background-color: #050505 !important; }\r\n#mw-head { background-color: #050505 !important; }\r\n#mw-panel { background-color: #050505 !important; }\r\ncode { background-color: #225 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs li a, div.vectorTabs li a span { color: #888 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs li.selected a, div.vectorTabs li.selected a span { color: #88f !important; background-color: #222 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs ul li { background-image: none !important; background-color: #111 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs li a { background-image: none !important; border-right: 1px solid #666 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs { background-image: none !important; border-left: 1px solid #666 !important; }\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":19800,"name":"thanks!","rating":0,"created":"2010-05-29T01:59:31.000Z","author_name":"SKYY","author_id":635},{"id":20422,"name":"White Lines","rating":0,"created":"2010-06-22T20:40:14.000Z","author_name":"4DarkAces","author_id":53514}],"discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/30211/skyy-s-dark-wikipedia-may2010-white-header-fix.user.js","style_settings":[]}
