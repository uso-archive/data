(Does not affect result.)\r\n\r\n--\r\n@user 16425 (again): Ok, I'm using display:none now. (v1.06) Which is what is should be using , not because it's shorter, but because it removes instead of hide, which is what I'm doing.\r\n@user 16425: No, I wouldn't want that, So I made it in a separate sheet: style 12128 fades instead of deleting.\r\n@user 16425: I did not know about the not() pseudoselector. I'm using it in v1.05 ; Thanks a million.\r\n@user 14957: This is now implemented in version 1.04 and higher. (I knew about this, but didn't know anyone cared)\r\n--\r\nRatings and comments are very welcome.","user":{"id":4880,"name":"DasRakel","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-01-06T23:28:57.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1130,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/4152_after.jpeg?r=1587801908","url":"/styles/4152/wikipedia-delete-languages","discussionsCount":4,"commentsCount":4,"css":"/*\r\n *                      Wikipedia   : Delete the languages you don't understand anyway.\r\n *\r\n * Author      : Rakel\r\n * Created     : 16 November 2007\r\n * Updated     : 06 January 2009\r\n * Version     : 1.06\r\n * Description : If you're like me, you only know four languages, so the others in the list are useless to you.\r\n * \r\n */\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(wikipedia.org), domain(wikibooks.org), domain(wikiversity.org), domain(wiktionary.org), domain(wikiquote.org), domain(wikisource.org), domain(wikimedia.org), domain(wikinews.org), domain(uncyclopedia.org){\r\n\r\n#p-lang li:not(.interwiki-nl):not(.interwiki-fr):not(.interwiki-en):not(.interwiki-de){display:none !important;}\r\n/*               Edit this^^  and the other language codes too */\r\n\r\n}"}
