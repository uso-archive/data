{"id":4152,"name":"Wikipedia - Delete languages","description":"Wikipedia : Delete the languages you don't understand anyway.\r\nIf you're like me, you only know four languages, so the others in wikipedia's list are useless to you.\r\nThis stylesheet deletes them.\r\n--\r\nVersion 1.03 works on all wikimedia projects and anything else that runs on the mediawiki.\r\nVersion 1.04 bugfix: The box is now only as long as needed to fit the languages you added.\r\nVersion 1.05 bugfix of 1.04; and marginal simplification of code, using the \"not()\" pseudo selector. users don't need to fill in pixel values anymore.\r\n(PS: this sheet is now one year old.  :D )\r\nVersion 1.06: Using display instead of visibility. (Does not affect result.)\r\n\r\n--\r\n@user 16425 (again): Ok, I'm using display:none now. (v1.06) Which is what is should be using , not because it's shorter, but because it removes instead of hide, which is what I'm doing.\r\n@user 16425: No, I wouldn't want that, So I made it in a separate sheet: style 12128 fades instead of deleting.\r\n@user 16425: I did not know about the not() pseudoselector. I'm using it in v1.05 ; Thanks a million.\r\n@user 14957: This is now implemented in version 1.04 and higher. (I knew about this, but didn't know anyone cared)\r\n--\r\nRatings and comments are very welcome.","user":{"id":4880,"name":"DasRakel","email":"karel@dasrakel.eu","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2009-01-06T23:28:57.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1156,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/4152_after.jpeg?r=1686556816","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-11-16T09:19:56.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"wikipedia","subcategory":"wikipedia","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n *                      Wikipedia   : Delete the languages you don't understand anyway.\r\n *\r\n * Author      : Rakel\r\n * Created     : 16 November 2007\r\n * Updated     : 06 January 2009\r\n * Version     : 1.06\r\n * Description : If you're like me, you only know four languages, so the others in the list are useless to you.\r\n * \r\n */\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(wikipedia.org), domain(wikibooks.org), domain(wikiversity.org), domain(wiktionary.org), domain(wikiquote.org), domain(wikisource.org), domain(wikimedia.org), domain(wikinews.org), domain(uncyclopedia.org){\r\n\r\n#p-lang li:not(.interwiki-nl):not(.interwiki-fr):not(.interwiki-en):not(.interwiki-de){display:none !important;}\r\n/*               Edit this^^  and the other language codes too */\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":1793,"name":"Excellent Script !","rating":0,"created":"2008-09-21T18:44:25.000Z","author_name":"John Arnbakle","author_id":14957},{"id":10475,"name":"Excellent script but is there a way to make the re","rating":3,"created":"2008-09-21T18:45:49.000Z","author_name":"John Arnbakle","author_id":14957},{"id":10852,"name":"My last post contained an error:\n\nIt's not suppo","rating":3,"created":"2008-12-07T18:25:42.000Z","author_name":"medjakov","author_id":16425},{"id":2165,"name":"style","rating":0,"created":"2009-01-01T20:43:38.000Z","author_name":"instigatorirc","author_id":16713}],"discussionsCount":4,"commentsCount":4,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/4152/wikipedia-delete-languages.user.js","style_settings":[]}
