{"id":62494,"name":"Minor YouTube Tweaks","description":"This is just a quick-and-simple personal style that helps with some little annoyances on YouTube:\r\n\r\n- Makes visited links dark grey. This works on both light and dark themes.\r\n- Hides player controls invisible when the mouse is not hovered over the video. This makes it easier to pause and take a screenshot without the player controls getting in the way.\r\n- Hides the 'Updated ToS' dialog in the bottom-left of the screen.","user":{"id":3284,"name":"BoffinBrain","email":"stylish@boffinbrain.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"https://www.deviantart.com/boffinbrain","about":"Web developer and UX designer.\r\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/boffinbrain\"\u003eGitHub\u003c/a\u003e • \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/boffinbrain\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e • \u003ca href=\"https://www.deviantart.com/boffinbrain\"\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/a\u003e","license":"ccbyncsa"},"updated":"2020-03-30T04:27:41.000Z","weekly_install_count":2,"total_install_count":213,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":null,"obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"publicdomain","created":"2012-03-13T16:43:22.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"youtube","subcategory":"youtube","additional_info":"V1.1.1 - 2020-03-30\r\nFixed selector for ToS modal so it shouldn't hide other modals.\r\n\r\nV1.1.0 - 2020-03-03\r\nInitial release.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis style ID was originally a user CSS for Leankit Kanban in 2012 but has now been repurposed, because UserStyles.org STILL doesn't allow users to properly delete styles.","style_tags":[],"css":"/* ==UserStyle==\r\n@name           YouTube Minor Tweaks\r\n@namespace      yt\r\n@version        1.1.1\r\n@description    Hides the player controls when the cursor is not over it, even when paused.
