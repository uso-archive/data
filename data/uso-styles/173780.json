{"id":173780,"name":"Dragalia Lost Gamepress/Gamepedia - Dark Theme","description":"A Dark Theme for Dragalia Lost Gamepress, I noticed that there were no themes for gamepress and my eyes didn't like summoning at 2 am at night while my heart did. Therefore, I produced this simple theme that makes the site darker WHILE keep some of the good things from the normal version (I.E. 5 stars turning red). This works on the entirety of the dragalia gamepress website as well as the entirety of the dragalialost.gamepedia, Enjoy!","user":{"id":816489,"name":"Griffnelle","email":"davemferrini@gmail.com","paypal_email":"pokedaveboy@gmail.com","homepage":"https://kenesu-h.github.io/cult-khezu/","about":"I like dragalia","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2020-02-22T20:03:13.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":138,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/173780_after.png?r=1686556816","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/173780_additional_34028.png?r=1686556816","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/173780_additional_34029.png?r=1686556816","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/173780_additional_35428.png?r=1686556816"],"license":"publicdomain","created":"2019-07-24T01:13:28.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"gamepress","subcategory":"gamepress","additional_info":"Uses code from Anon4k's Global theme and modifies it to fit the two site\r\n\r\nVer 2.0 Added support for Gamepedia\r\n\r\nVer 2.1 Added support for DPS simulators\r\n\r\nVer 2.2 Added support for another DPS simulator","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://gamepress.gg/dragalialost\"), url-prefix(\"https://dragalialost.gamepedia.com/\"), url-prefix(\"https://mushymato.github.io/\"), url-prefix(\"https://wildshinobu.pythonanywhere.com/\"), url-prefix(\"https://b1ueb1ues.github.io/dl-sim-vue/#/\") {\r\nhtml {\r\n    filter: invert(0.95) hue-rotate(180deg);\r\n    -webkit-filter: invert(0.95) hue-rotate(180deg);\r\n    -moz-filter: invert(0.95) hue-rotate(180deg);\r\n    -ms-filter: invert(0.95) hue-rotate(180deg);\r\n    -o-filter: invert(0.95) hue-rotate(180deg);\r\n    background:black;\r\n}\r\nimg, embed, video, canvas, iframe, svg, span.Emoticon, span.emoji, i.emoji, div#p-logo {\r\n    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg) !important;\r\n    -webkit-filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg) !important;\r\n    -moz-filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg) !important;\r\n    -ms-filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg) !important;\r\n    -o-filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg) !important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/173780/dragalia-lost-gamepress-gamepedia-dark-theme.user.js","style_settings":[]}
