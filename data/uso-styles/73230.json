Now the style also works on those tumblr themes with the logo and search bar.\r\n\r\nAdded a LGBT+ Pride version of the logo. To install, click on Advanced Style Settings, change from Normal to Pride, and click on update style (if instead of the \u003ci\u003eupdate style\u003c/i\u003e button you see the \u003ci\u003estyle updated\u003c/i\u003e one, just refresh the page)\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Be Proud! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Credit to \u003ca href=\"http://codeman38.tumblr.com/post/162380885458/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ecodeman38\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e on tumblr for the code for disabling the logo animation (which I don't know if it makes a difference with these kind of scripts, but it doesn't hurt to try).\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n*UPDATE* 3/04/2017\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e*shakes fists angrily at Tumblr*\u003c/i\u003e\r\nFixed so the new logo won't show.\r\n\r\n\r\n*UPDATE* 5/04/2015\r\n\r\nI leave Tumblr for a couple of days, and when I come back they've done unnecessary changes again.
