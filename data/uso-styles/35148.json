You have the option to remove the navigation bars up top if you do not use them. \r\n\r\nThe only issue I have found with this bit of coding is when you just happen to come across a posting picture with a width of 300px or height of 90px, because I used that reference to remove parts of the page. In the months I have used it, I have only come across one posting like that though, so not an issue imo.","user":{"id":58252,"name":"AlienPoison","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2010-08-01T12:00:53.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":224,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/35148_after.gif?r=1677312015","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-08-01T12:00:53.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"i-am-bored","subcategory":"i-am-bored","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"i-am-bored.com\")\r\n{\r\n\r\n[height=\"90\"], [class=\"top_page_header\"], [width=\"300\"], [vspace=\"5\"],[alt=\"Advertisement\"], [style=\"margin: 3px auto 5px;\"]\r\n\r\n/*===== THE CODE BELOW REMOVES THE NAVAGATION BAR AND SUB NAVIAGTION BAR.
