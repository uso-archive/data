{"id":24728,"name":"Tab Color Underscoring active/read/unread (Fx3.6 )","description":"Colors the \r\nborders of a tab with  RED for active tab,  BLUE  for a normal tab,  GREEN for a still unread tab, MAGENTA(FUCHSIA) for loading/reloading tab.   In other words distinguishes tabs as active tab, viewed tab, unviewed tab.  Does not affect the background color of a tab  so that color usage of  \"Perma Tabs\"  (\"Perma Tabs Mod\"), and/or \"Multiple Tab Handler\"  extensions will prevail.   Bottom border color will show up even if tabs on the tabs bar have been squeezed down so much that only the favicon can be seen.\r\n\r\nThe style for \u003cb\u003eFirefox 29\u003c/b\u003e (Fx29, Australis) is\u003cb\u003e style 101570 \u003c/b\u003e(101570),  you will still need the TabVisted extension in Fx29, described below.\r\n\r\nYou must install the TabVisited extension to use this style  (see below).","user":{"id":12592,"name":"David McRitchie","email":"dmcritchie@hotmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://kb.mozillazine.org/User:Dmcritchie","about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"updated":"2011-04-11T18:52:44.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":2654,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/24728_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-01-31T04:58:10.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":"\u003csmall\u003eThis Notes area has separate vertical scrolling, such scrolling may be invisible until you move cursor over them.  Having to scroll is bad design and I have nothing to with Firefox, Styling documentation design, or some extension that makes this happen beginning somewhere before Firefox 29.

Firefox 29 and above need to use style 101570 (101570) \r\nThe reason and suggested code changes can be seen in\r\n  [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=487242 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=487242]\r\n  [http://kb.mozillazine.org/User:Dickvl/TabVisited http://kb.mozillazine.org/User:Dickvl/TabVisited] \r\nInstall TabVisited 2.5 to use in Firefox 4.0 \r\n\r\nConsider this style to be a TEST  for now until the supporting code which can be installed from comment 6 of bug 487242 becomes part of Firefox.\r\n\r\nIf you get the following error for [JavaScript Application]\r\n TypeError: Components,classes['@mozilla.org/webshell;1)'] is undefined\r\nthen you did not install the TabVisited extension in bug 487242#c6\r\n\r\nFirefox 4.0 shows tab favicon changes builtin): (CW is clockwise, CCW is counter-clockwise) not an indication of whether page is read or not though.\r\nCCW and gray: we have sent the request and are waiting for the server to respond.\r\nCW  and blue: we have started getting data back from the server and are working on rendering the page.\r\n\r\n=================================================\r\n\r\nAn unread tab is one that has been opened in the background such as with a mouse shortcut,  and will also be seen for tabs restored from a terminated session.\r\n\r\nWhen a tab is opened in the  background the current tab remains active (Ctrl+Shift+click) \r\nWhen a tab is opened in the foreground the the new tab becomes active (Ctrl+click).\r\nThe mouse shortcuts  that I use above are reversed from Firefox's default because I checkmark the option at  Tools, Options, Tabs, [x] When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately.   \r\n\r\nMy method of reading most web pages is to stay within the article, opening links in the background at the far right of the tabs bar, when I have finished reading all of the originally selected pages, I start reading the new pages in the same manner, new tabs to the a right after all they are secondary material.   I try not to build up layers within a tab, so that I can tell for sure when I am finished with a tab.    Especially when reading Blogs where I start with several blogs by opening them from a folder on my bookmarks toolbar.\r\n\r\nIf \"private browsing\" for the active tab in particular can be determined might add an  dotted black  border  at top of tab.
