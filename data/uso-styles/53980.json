I fixed this, and it looks better. If you already had this script installed, you might need to erase your cache.\r\nOctober 1, 2011 - Facebook changed some things on the site rendering \"Facepalm\" completely invisible. This has been fixed.\r\nOctober 7, 2011 - Facebook changed some things on the site rendering \"Facepalm\" completely invisible. This has been fixed.\r\nOctober 7, 2011 - Changed Data URI to a URL.\r\nOctober 26, 2011 - Facebook changed some things on the site rendering \"Facepalm\" completely invisible. This has been fixed.",
