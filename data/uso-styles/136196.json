One of the issues is the stuff below the video player; Title, description, more videos etc are a fixed distance down the page. This means if you have the browser window small there will be a big gap. If the height of your browser is \u003e1080p it might be under the video. Also there's sometimes an advert before the main video, you can't press the skip button. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/\"), url-prefix(\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/\") {\r\n#bbcMediaPlayer0{\r\n    height: 100vh !important;\r\n    width: 100vw !important;\r\n    margin: auto !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.gel-wrap{\r\n    margin-left: 0px !important;\r\n    padding-left: 0px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n#orb-header, .ipNav.ipNav--iplayer {\r\n  display: none\r\n} \r\n\r\n#main{\r\n    padding-top: 0px !important\r\n}\r\n\r\n.playback-gradient{\r\n    padding-top:50vh !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.orb-footer{\r\n    background-color: #000;\r\n    color: #444\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/136196/iplayer-full-theater-mode.user.js","style_settings":[]}
