Tumblr made the inline images full width. idk why. But now they're not.\r\n\u003cstrong\u003e11/18/14 12:00AM\u003c/strong\u003e - Fixed the video issues in Firefox. They're full width again, sorry, i can't give them margins without them completely breaking :/ Some people claimed margin issues in Firefox and I couldn't reproduce it, but I hope the fixes took care of it either way.\r\n\u003cstrong\u003e11/13/14 1:40PM\u003c/strong\u003e - Sorry, didn't catch everything yesterday. Videos should be fixed now as well as inline images! \r\n\u003cstrong\u003e11/12/14 1:50PM\u003c/strong\u003e - Tumblr made an update. MY FAVORITE! They changed how some of their photo classes work. Who knows, it's weird. Let's see if these two changes fix it.  \r\n\u003cstrong\u003e11/7/14 6:20PM\u003c/strong\u003e - Tumblr made an update that changed the max width photos are on the dash. I think they're kinda sorta trying to fix the upload issue. But only kinda. Anyway, fixed the issue of photos that are larger than 500px getting cut off. \r\n\u003cstrong\u003e11/4/14 3PM\u003c/strong\u003e - Alright, after some consideration I'm removing the fix for photosets on individual blogs and leaving this as just a dash fix. That said, the fix for viewing \u003cem\u003ephotosets on other people's blogs\u003c/em\u003e is going to be offered as \u003ca href=\"https://userstyles.org/styles/106863/fix-for-images-on-tumblr-blogs\"\u003ea separate style HERE\u003c/a\u003e. It causes some issues with certain blogs but I know some people still want to use it so it's a hard call. Tumblr did some ridiculous things to their photo API and there's only so much I can do with CSS alone.

But I should have all my bases covered by now. I hope.
