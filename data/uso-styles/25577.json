{"id":25577,"name":"Firefox - Upside-down Tabs for Elementary Theme","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","style_tags":[],"description":"I whipped this up quickly after not finding any other styles that gave the results I wanted. This theme was made for the Elementary theme for Firefox on Ubuntu. I cannot guarantee results on other operating systems or with other themes. In fact, I'm fairly certain it'd look horrible with any other themes. :P\r\n\r\nIt was inspired by style 13511 by user 14809. I admit that I referenced his code in order to figure out what everything did, as this is the first style I've ever made. I kept the code simple as I don't think I could do much else. If I can figure it out, I'll try to get some subtle gradients in the tabs later, and maybe tweak the borders a bit. Feel free to leave suggestions and tips!\r\n\r\n//UPDATES\r\n- Added highlight on mouse-over to unselected tabs\r\n- Gave active tab a gradient\r\n\r\n//MORE UPDATES\r\n- Tab strip and inactive tabs now have gradient backgrounds. Probably won't update it any more beyond this unless the Elementary theme changes significantly.\r\n\r\n//YET MORE UPDATES\r\nA user on the Elementary Project forums created a modified version of this theme for the Tabs-on-Top extension for Firefox. It's really nice and I recommend checking it out! http://www.elementary-project.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=177#p177","user":{"id":42629,"name":"Ramsey","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2010-03-01T04:25:10.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":609,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/25577_after.png?r=1574496080","url":"/styles/25577/firefox-upside-down-tabs-for-elementary-theme","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/* Created by Ramsey G. 02/2010; inspired by \"Upside-Down Tabs [Safari-tabs]\" by xren */\r\n\r\n/* Note that this was only tested in Ubuntu Karmic with the Elementary Theme.
