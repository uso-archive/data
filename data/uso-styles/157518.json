(I did test with those disabled however, ad insertion tactics change so frequently that global filters seem to work better than css.)\r\n\r\nAs with any user style this one may grow less effective if the target web pages are tweaked by the author. In the (unlikely) event that I stop frequenting the target web site then I am less likely to update the style.\r\n\r\nMy approach is to use the lowest specificity that satisfies my goal.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I get confused trying to construct selectors at higher levels of specificity and I have yet to find a decent tutorial on the subject to cure me of that handicap! And besides, the precedence of user !important rules over author !important rules should make specificity an unnecessary refinement except in those unusual cases where useful content is mixed in with \"less-useful\" content.\r\n\r\nUsually my goal is to eliminate distractions, whether those be ads or click bait for related content regardless of how tenuous that \"relationship\" might be.
