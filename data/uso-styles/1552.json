This is a trunk only issue that affects forums running CommunityServer software.\r\n\r\nOK, this isn't a great style but it's my first attempt at contributing to userstyles.org. I'll add more sites as I come across them.\r\n\r\nUpdate: This style is redundant since bug 359769 is fixed on trunk (as of 2007-01-23)","user":{"id":473,"name":"Wildmyron","email":"wildmyron@yahoo.com.au","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2006-12-20T16:40:15.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":249,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/1552-after.png?r=1685692814","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-12-20T16:40:15.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"thedailywtf","subcategory":"thedailywtf","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"thedailywtf.com\"),\r\n    url-prefix(\"http://msforums.ph/forums/\"),\r\n    url-prefix(\"http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/wow/community/forums/\") {\r\n.CommonRateControlReadOnly { display: inline !important; }\r\n.ForumThreadRateControlReadOnly { display: inline !important; }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/1552/fix-for-bug-359769-huge-white-space-on-the-page.user.js","style_settings":[]}
