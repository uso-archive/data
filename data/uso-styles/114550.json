My work and play cross paths often since I get a lot of joy out of what I do and study, some of which are:\r\n\r\n- Perl + CPAN Developer\r\n- Linux C++ Developer (Qt4, Qt5, KDE4, KFM5, and related)\r\n- Shell Script Developer (Perl, BASH, sh, upstart, vim plugin development)\r\n- Web Style Developer (CSS, SaSS, SGML, HTML5, etc) though I do know HTML4 too [who doesn't?]\r\n- Windows C++ Developer (Old Pro in Microsoft related technologies)\r\n- Old-School Technologies (qbasic, vbdos, borland c++, ms-dos 6.66, i386 assembler /w emphasis on _some_ 64-bit stuff)\r\n- Music Hobbyist (Electronic Music Writer, Piano, Keyboard player/Enthusiast)\r\n- Graphic Artist (Pencil/Pen/Watercolor physical media, Maya/Blender/3DSMax/Bryce/Gimp/Photoshop HD and post-production)\r\n\r\nI am not currently in any group at the time. I am not sure if I will be doing that ever again. The last few groups I participated in were too incoherent and seemed to have different ideals, ethics, goals. \r\n\r\nI am open to suggestion or requests, just don't make them impossible for a single person to do. Requesting a theme have a black version is probably okay. Requesting that I personally show up and restyle your entire website is probably not. Of course, if I were getting paid to do it, that would be a whole other matter, but I rarely see people paying for such things these days when you can hire someone in another country to do it for 2 cents -- that's right I'm a bitter man :D= <- those are vampire teeth!!","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2015-05-31T14:39:54.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":93,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/114550_after.jpeg?r=1596873970","url":"/styles/114550/justanimedubbed-tv-darkified","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/* justanimedubbed.tv \r\n\r\n   Darkified - \"Watch Cartoons & Anime English Dubbed Online!\"\r\n\r\n   written by Gabriel Sharp <email below>\r\n\r\n   This style was downloaded from:\r\n\r\n  http://userstyles.org/users/87204   \r\n  \r\n\r\n  email: <osirisgothra@hotmail.com>\r\n\r\n  ABOUT\r\n\r\n   Go and get the latest one and read the style description for the basic, not-listed-here, details.\r\n\r\n  REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n   - internet connection :)\r\n   - mozilla, chrome, or webkit-based browsers reccomended\r\n   - adblock plus, or something like it\r\n   - noscript (selective script disabler) is a must**\r\n\r\n   *If you don't use noscript, jad is pretty useless unless your \r\n    internet is > 10MBit, and your machine can process 5+ threads CPU\r\n   *No, you can not just disable ALL scripts, the scripts on JAD and\r\n    uploadcrazy MUST run or you wont be able to see any player. \r\n   *Chat users: mouse-over the chat area to show the chat window (upper\r\n    left hand corner of the screen!)\r\n\r\n    a screen at 720p or better (windowed) and rec  at least 1080p\r\n    for fullscreen :)\r\n\r\n    The background and any other misc graphics were created by me, so\r\n    please do not steal them w/o honoring the userstyles-invoked license\r\n    residing on this style!\r\n\r\n    PLEASE SEND ME SPEED INCREASE REPORTS\r\n\r\n    I really want to hear feedback about speed increase/decreases as\r\n    a result of using this style.
