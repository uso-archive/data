Woohoo!\r\n\r\nNEW - Version 1.6 - Facebook has changed lots of element names and broken some parts of this. There's currently no way to change the background-color of chat boxes without also changing the colour of the timeline post time stamps.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.5 - Yet another fix for Facebook changing the names of divs. My life has become an eternal struggle of updating this every few days.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.4 - Brightens that horrible new dark grey background on the new Timeline by a bit. Personal touch. If you don't like it, just go into Stylish and remove the \"._5vb_, ._5vb_ #contentCol {\" section.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3 - Pretty sure Facebook is out to get me at this point, some additional div name changes and more !important tags.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2 - Facebook broke something, I added !important to things now it works again!\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 - Facebook removed \".bubbles\" div class, which broke the script. Fixed by removing on un-bubbler too.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 - un-bubbles chat, gets rid of box shadow and text shadow, gets rid of gradients.\r\n\r\nContact me @falolout for feedback!","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"facebook.com\") {\r\n\r\n ._1nc6 ._5w1r, ._1nc6 ._5w1r:before {\r\n      border-bottom-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, .18) !important;\r\n      -webkit-border-radius: 0px !important;\r\n      -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 0 #dce0e6 !important;\r\n      text-shadow: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 0 0 0 !important;\r\n      background-image: none !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  /* commented out because this no longer works, and facebook screwed with element names. currently there is no way to change the background-color of the chat boxes without also changing the colour of the timeline post timestamps.\r\n  \r\n  ._1nc6 ._5w1r, ._1nc6 ._5w1r:before{\r\n      background-color: #dbedfe !important;\r\n      background-image: none !important;\r\n  }\r\n     \r\n */ \r\n \r\n/* background colour fix */\r\n\r\n  ._1nc7 ._5w1r, ._1nc7 ._5w1r:before {\r\n      background-color: #FFFFFF !important;\r\n      background-image: none !important;\r\n      border-radius: 0px !important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  body._5vb_ #globalContainer, html ._5vb_.hasLeftCol #contentCol, ._li {\r\n      background-color: #F7F7F7;\r\n  }  \r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/95518/facebook-chat-un-bubbler.user.js","style_settings":[]}
