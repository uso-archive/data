If anybody wants to contribute to updating the spreadsheet, they are more than welcome. Just link your updated spreadsheet in the feedback/discussion section. When doing so, don't forget to comment on the latest familiar you have added or any edits you have made. \r\n\r\n\r\n(1-May-2017) - Added Water Goblin \u0026 New Training Fields Mobs. Thinking of removing the border from the style to lessen the burden of adding data to the sheets.\r\n(6-Feb-2017) - Sorted the new familiars back into alphabetical order.\r\n(22-Jan-2017) - Sorted the new familiars back into alphabetical order.\r\n(24-Oct-2016) - Unmerged the columns in the \"Add new familiar\" sheets because it was being annoying when copying things over. Sorted the new familiars back into alphabetical order.\r\n(14-Oct-2016) - Moved the greasemonkey code into the non-baldwin tab and changed to sheet colours to look nicer/ more colour coded. Changed the name of the first sheet from \"Chart\" to \"original code\".\r\n(23-Sep-2016) - GoldThroated Sparrow formerly recorded as ID#3071, now corrected to ID#727 and Yellow-Throated sparrowmouse corrected to ID#3071\r\n(13-Sep-2016) - Added greasemonkey-friendly code sheets\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo avoid the displacement problem in baldwin, remove\r\n\" border: inset 2px orange; border-radius: 12px; \"\r\nfrom the CSS and just set opacity to a decimal between 0.1 and 0.9. I like 0.4\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eSafari compatibility issue:\u003c/b\u003e remove apostrophes from familiar names. For some reason the stylish add-on for safari doesn't ignore them.\r\n___\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eHow it works/ how to add familiars to the CSS:\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\r\nIf you already have a list of awakened familiars, good on you! Copy-paste it into the yellow section of the spreadsheet and it should spit out the codes you need. Copy these codes.\r\n\r\nIn your browser, go to manage styles \u003e find this one in the list \u003e edit \u003e paste the codes into the area specified \u003e save. The stylish should now work.\r\n\r\n- - - -\r\n\r\nTo add the familiar manually to the CSS, you'll need to find it's item ID, to find it yourself, right-click the familiar icon, copy image location and you should get something like \"http://flightrising.com/images/cms/familiar/341.png\", in this case, 341 is the ID. For mass familiar updates, if you know how to, use your browser's web developer tools to inspect the code and it'll be quicker then  the other method.\r\n\r\nIf you missed it above, \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bRsBZLqAJJ3tdHr41xyis89zemXURbuEynL2taxf7XA/edit?usp=sharing\"\u003eHere's the google Spreadsheet, you'll need to make a copy.\u003c/a\u003e\r\n\r\nNote: Only applies to the official FR images.\r\n\r\nMake sure to back up your list of awakened familiars.
