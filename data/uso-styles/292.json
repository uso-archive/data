{"id":292,"name":"Visited Links PNG Image (based on marcanth's)","description":"Many thanks to marcanth, and his source Roger Johansson, for a GREAT script I've already given 5 stars.  Problem was I couldn't get the image to work, and then found a character map symbol which worked in Stylish, but not in userContent.  I've put the image BEFORE the link, and rewritten the code more precisely  thanks to Paweï¿½ Kubisz (cyberrus) and the PDF icon script  (\"a[href]\") - and come up with this PNG/base 64 version which works BOTH in Stylish and userContent.  I'm grateful to marcanth for finding this as now, even with my black background Google IMage Search script in effect, I still get an indicator of \"visited image\" as well as links (see screenshots).","user":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","paypal_email":"paulbrit@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2006-04-20T18:54:52.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":2462,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/292_after.gif?r=1687593612","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-04-20T18:54:52.000Z","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*Coded by Paulfox April 20th 2006, based on original script by marcanth */\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\na[href]:visited:before { content: url(\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAkAAAAMCAYAAACwXJejAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAGElEQVQYlWP8b2z8n4EAYCKkYFTRQCgCADY%2BAnyGRbu9AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\");  padding-right:5px; }","discussions":[{"id":3871,"name":"Doesnt work anymore! worked great but now I miss i","rating":3,"created":"2006-05-12T01:43:43.000Z","author_name":"Kid_ReeFer","author_id":162},{"id":3830,"name":"Thanks, Paulfox.
