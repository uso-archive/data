In the future I plan to take more requests but I don't have the time and I'm not as familiar with the code as I'd like to be.\r\n\r\nI will use code from another theme if it's something I couldn't find by myself or if there are elements in it I'd like for my theme. I will always reference and link any themes I have used code from.\r\n\r\nIf there's something I've missed or you think I could improve feel free to message me on here or my <a href=\"http://distortedthemes.tumblr.com\">tumblr</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you like my themes enough to donate you can do so. I'm trying to get a new computer and need to pay for University so any extra income is appreciated.","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2013-07-28T23:23:11.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":47,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":null,"url":"/styles/91157/impractical-google-v01","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://www.google.com\"), url-prefix(\"http://www.google.com\") {\r\n#gbx3 {\r\nborder-color: #000;\r\nbackground: url(http://i1314.photobucket.com/albums/t577/DistortedOutsider/Backgrounds/CarbonFibre.png);\r\nopacity: 1;\r\nfilter: alpha(opacity=100);\r\n}\r\n\r\nbody {\r\nbackground: url(http://media.tumblr.com/16f6ef9cd998310ccc998c0cf3db7c58/tumblr_inline_mqk81x7xmM1rlx4pg.png);\r\n}\r\n\r\n#hplogo {\r\nbackground: url(http://media.tumblr.com/255af24f9607c343287b70bcd864552f/tumblr_inline_mqk8j6I5rl1rlx4pg.png) no-repeat !important;\r\nbackground-size: 275px 95px;\r\nheight: 95px;\r\nwidth: 275px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#hplogo div {\r\ndisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#gbvg {\r\nbackground: -webkit-linear-gradient(left, #f00 20%,#ff7300 40%, #ff0 60%, #0f0 80%, #00f 100%);\r\nbackground: -moz-linear-gradient(left, #f00 20%,#ff7300 40%, #ff0 60%, #0f0 80%, #00f 100%);\r\n}\r\n\r\n#fll {\r\nbackground: -webkit-linear-gradient(left, #00f 20%,#0f0 40%, #ff0 60%, #ff7300 80%, #f00 100%);\r\nbackground: -moz-linear-gradient(left, #f00 20%,#ff7300 40%, #ff0 60%, #0f0 80%, #00f 100%);\r\n}\r\n\r\n#gbi4t, #gbi4t a, #fll a {\r\ncolor: #000 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.gbqfba {\r\nbackground-color: #f0f;\r\nbackground-image: none;\r\ncolor: #000;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#gbqfsa, #gbqfsb {\r\ncolor: #000;\r\n}\r\n}"}
