{"id":91157,"name":"Impractical Google V01","description":"A theme I made purely to annoy people who wanted to use my laptop when I was gone. A friend asked me to upload it. Do not use it if you want to be able to see search results properly.","user":{"id":190599,"name":"DistortedOutsider","email":"myacidicromance@live.com","paypal_email":"hayden.dittmann@outlook.com","homepage":"http://distortedthemes.tumblr.com/","about":"At the moment I only make themes for sites I use often or when requested by a friend. In the future I plan to take more requests but I don't have the time and I'm not as familiar with the code as I'd like to be.\r\n\r\nI will use code from another theme if it's something I couldn't find by myself or if there are elements in it I'd like for my theme. I will always reference and link any themes I have used code from.\r\n\r\nIf there's something I've missed or you think I could improve feel free to message me on here or my \u003ca href=\"http://distortedthemes.tumblr.com\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e.\r\n\r\nIf you like my themes enough to donate you can do so. I'm trying to get a new computer and need to pay for University so any extra income is appreciated.","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2013-07-28T23:23:11.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":53,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":null,"obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2013-07-28T23:23:11.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":"It was designed to look horrible and reduce functionality so please don't spam me with complaints.
