I use this very style for a few other websites.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 3/28/2013\r\nUpdated for the new new theme of TwitchTV, I removed the sidebar on the left side and made it so the video player fills your entire screen.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 1/17/2014\r\nFor some reason, the video player was really small now. I fixed it so it's big again.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document \r\ndomain(\"twitch.tv\")\r\n{body[bgcolor] {\r\nbackground-color: #000 !important;\r\nbackground-image: none !important; \r\ncolor: #00bb00 !important;\r\nfont-weight: bolder;}\r\na {font-weight:bolder;}\r\n\r\n* {font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: 10pt; background-color: #000 !important; color: #00cc00 !important}\r\n* {border: none !important;}\r\n\r\ndiv#left_col {display:none !important}\r\ndiv.scroll-content {padding:0 !important}\r\ndiv {margin-left:0 !important}\r\n\r\n.dynamic-player, .dynamic-player object, .dynamic-player video {\r\n    width: 100%  !important;\r\n    height: 520px !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/84713/green-on-black-for-twitchtv-n0lif3-1-2014-update.user.js","style_settings":[]}
