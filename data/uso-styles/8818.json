Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has rounded perfectly on each.\r\nFeel free to customize the transparency level (described above) ... no reposting mods though!\r\n* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8414 for this style to work!! **\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n+ Works on Firefox3\r\n+ Works on SongBird\r\n\r\nIntegrates with the following Styles:\r\n+ Style 8414\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8414 for this style to work!! **\r\n+ Style 8028\r\n\r\nWorks well with:\r\n+ All of the Glasser (Vista Glass) / Transparent styles\r\n+ The Styles Displayed above\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.2:\r\n+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.1\r\n+ Added Huge Update to decrease the transparency when your mouse hovers over the menus.\r\n+ This update makes the menus easier to read when your navigating them.\r\n+ You can customize this new feature to make them entirely opaque when hovering (or any other level of transparency)","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-11-24T18:41:55.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":5443,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/8818_after.png?r=1593849925","url":"/styles/8818/transparent-menus-popups-wow","discussionsCount":5,"commentsCount":6,"css":"/*\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                    |\r\n|          Title:  |  Transparent Menus (WOW)                           |\r\n|    Description:  |  Transparency for all menus and popups             |\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                           |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  July 15 2008                                      |\r\n|   Last Updated:  |  November 24, 2008                                 |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.2                                           |\r\n|__________________|____________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n\r\n/* Transparent Menus (regular conditions): */\r\npopup:not(#autoscroller), menupopup\r\n{\r\n  opacity:0.7 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Custom (or remove) transparency when hovering over menu */\r\npopup:not(#autoscroller):hover, menupopup:hover\r\n{\r\n  opacity: 0.92 !important;\r\n}"}
