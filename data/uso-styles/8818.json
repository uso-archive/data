{"id":8818,"name":"Transparent Menus Popups (WOW)","description":"Gives you Transparency on all menus, poups and toolbar drop-downs.\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8414 for this style to work!! **\r\n\r\n* Thanks to user 6431 for introducing me into the realm of Transparency with style 6771\r\n\r\nYou can Customize the amount of transparency by editing the Opacity in the code (Closer to 0 is closer to invisible, whereas closer to 1 is closer to fully-visible - EXAMPLE: 0.5 is in the middle of opacity)\r\n\r\nThis makes your menus look really cool.\r\nThis style supports only Firefox3, giving it even more of a WOW effect!.\r\n\r\nApplies to:\r\n+ File, Edit, View, History, Bookmarks, Tools and Help menus\r\n+ Navigation Toolbar (example: right clicking on back button)\r\n+ Main Context Menu (Right clicking on any web page)\r\n+ Right-Clicking on a tab (rounds the menus)\r\n+ Right-Clicking on the Location Bar (address bar)\r\n+ Also Applies to EVERY single menu on any window of a popup or pane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes! Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has rounded perfectly on each.\r\nFeel free to customize the transparency level (described above) ... no reposting mods though!\r\n* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8414 for this style to work!! **\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n+ Works on Firefox3\r\n+ Works on SongBird\r\n\r\nIntegrates with the following Styles:\r\n+ Style 8414\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8414 for this style to work!! **\r\n+ Style 8028\r\n\r\nWorks well with:\r\n+ All of the Glasser (Vista Glass) / Transparent styles\r\n+ The Styles Displayed above\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.2:\r\n+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.1\r\n+ Added Huge Update to decrease the transparency when your mouse hovers over the menus.\r\n+ This update makes the menus easier to read when your navigating them.\r\n+ You can customize this new feature to make them entirely opaque when hovering (or any other level of transparency)","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"benbenben3@msn.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-11-24T18:41:55.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":5469,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/8818_after.png?r=1676275212","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-07-15T17:00:06.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                    |\r\n|          Title:  |  Transparent Menus (WOW)                           |\r\n|    Description:  |  Transparency for all menus and popups             |\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                           |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  July 15 2008                                      |\r\n|   Last Updated:  |  November 24, 2008                                 |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.2                                           |\r\n|__________________|____________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n\r\n/* Transparent Menus (regular conditions): */\r\npopup:not(#autoscroller), menupopup\r\n{\r\n  opacity:0.7 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Custom (or remove) transparency when hovering over menu */\r\npopup:not(#autoscroller):hover, menupopup:hover\r\n{\r\n  opacity: 0.92 !important;\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":6565,"name":"fantastic. like it very much","rating":3,"created":"2009-05-09T16:20:37.000Z","author_name":"owen","author_id":13591},{"id":13071,"name":"oooooooh\n\nI like the focus/blur differences in o","rating":3,"created":"2009-08-08T17:58:31.000Z","author_name":"TubThump","author_id":26638},{"id":15085,"name":"Does what it said it would do.","rating":3,"created":"2009-11-28T03:02:10.000Z","author_name":"althea","author_id":33334},{"id":17925,"name":"Why does it have to be used with Rounded Menu's to work??","rating":1,"created":"2010-03-08T23:30:17.000Z","author_name":"kittybella","author_id":43758},{"id":22227,"name":"Works great without \"must installed along with...\"","rating":3,"created":"2010-09-21T10:42:54.000Z","author_name":"ThePhantasma","author_id":62843}],"discussionsCount":5,"commentsCount":6,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
