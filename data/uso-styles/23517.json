{"id":23517,"name":"MySpace 1.3 Home Screen for Music Profiles","description":"Updated: Yes, it's been like 20 minutes since I uploaded this lol, but I added the artist dashboard to the code, so now you can keep track of your stats.  It appears in the top right corner.  If you don't want it, lookin the code at the bottom for the designated area, and remove that part of the code and the dashboard won't show.   Hope you guys enjoy this script!\r\n\r\nEdit (Again): Something happened with the home page code again, and it messed up the sizes of the boxes. So, I edited the code to make it fit to what happened. The \"Stream\" box is fixed back to the right sized, the bulletins were moved up and made taller. The friends box has been changed to a scrolling box. That way you don't have a mess when using a friend count different than 12. Hope it works for everyone. If not, edit the code to your liking. Have fun!\r\n\r\nEdit: I have fixed a few things. The left column has been made smaller width-wise, so it looks better. The BIG gaping hole is fixed now. If you need to make it taller or shorter, go into the code, you will see where to edit it at to fix the height. The IM no longer has the main background in the code. I had to open up another namespace separate for that Iframe so that I could set the background to none.\r\n\r\nSo, Tom decided it was time to change the home screen again, rendering my Home Page Beautifulizer or whatever it was called stylish script useless. Not only that, the \"Stream\" now includes status updates AND all the photo and music and etc updates as well. The list for the \"Stream\" section is HUGE! So, I sat down, looked at the source of the home page, and made an all-new stylish script. I don't know how well it will work for you, but try it, edit the code to your pleasure. Just make sure to reference to me if you use any of my code. Thank you very much, and enjoy this script!\r\n\r\nList of edits/changes:\r\n-Top Banner is removed\r\n-Entire right column is removed\r\n-Left column is statically positioned in the top left corner, minus the apps and ads boxes.\r\n-The row 1 (your name, URL, Page themes, Date, etc.) has been removed as it is irrelevant.\r\n-Custom background\r\n-Footer removed\r\n-Stream box and status have static size and overflow, so if the content become to big, they automatically scroll.\r\n-The bulletins box has been moved to the right of the status and stream box. It too is scrollable if the content is too big.\r\n-The friends box has code that allows more friends to fit on one line.\r\n\r\nBackground used (edited to be a blue tint): http://whatsamahoozit.deviantart.com/art/Background-Orange-Grunge-117517582\r\n\r\nNotes (and bugs): This DOES work for music profiles, unlike the standard userstyle I originally made. Edit the code to fix it your way. This should be used on resolutions 1440x900 and up. Anything below, I cannot guarantee it will show as I have. There are a few bugs, most of which I have no knowledge on how to fix. If you update your status, it works fine, but it shows what you posted in the birthday's scrollbox (may be fixed now).\r\n","user":{"id":32593,"name":"TrYp.MyNe","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-12-22T09:12:23.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":425,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/23517_after.gif?r=1677744014","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-12-22T08:16:42.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"myspace","subcategory":"myspace","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"  /* MySpace 1.3.0 Home Screen for Music Profiles */\r\n  /* Customized by TrYp MyNe for your convenience */\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"home.myspace.com\") {\r\n\r\n  body {margin:0 auto; background: url(http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j80/baller_on_24z/whatsamahoozit.jpg) top center fixed !important;}\r\n\r\n  /* Hide right column which is full of crap */\r\n  div#col1_2 {display:block !important;}\r\n\r\n  /* Get rid of that column under your display pic */\r\n  div#module4 {display:none !important;}\r\n  div#module5 {display:none !important;}\r\n\r\n  /* Get rid of the footer.
