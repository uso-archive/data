{"id":70285,"name":"Epic Scrolls","description":"New customisable scroll bar which can forever replace your current ugly scollbar with what ever you desire (so long as your CSS savvy).\r\n\r\n***NOTICE: This is for Chrome users only. You must have the Dev release version (haven't tested Beta, let me know). UPDATE : Probably work for release now. It has been updated to 21, so perhaps.***\r\n\r\nHere's the Chrome Dev Release. It doesn't reinstall your whole browser, just updates it to the latest version.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/eula.html?extra=devchannel\r\n\r\n\r\nThis replaces the scroll bar everywhere except Google.com for the fact that Google made browser feature and they wanted to \r\nbe dicks by using javascript to prevent us using scroll bar styles on their site?? Makes sense, right?\r\n\r\nEDIT: 30/7/12 - Tested on beta.
