{"id":668,"name":"DSmeet.com Forums | Remove forum rules box","description":"On DSmeet's forums, a box containing forum rules is often displayed on top of forum pages. Seeing as how I'm a moderator and I don't need to be reminded of the rules all the time, I made this style to remove the box on the default revolution skin. Please, however, obey the rules and don't use this style as an excuse to be a troublemaker.","user":{"id":517,"name":"Sakurina","email":"kirbykirbykirby@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2006-07-20T15:41:20.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":159,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/668-after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-07-20T15:41:20.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"dsmeet","subcategory":"dsmeet","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/* DSmeet Forums - Remove forum rules */\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"forums.dsmeet.com\") {\r\n\r\n.forum_rules {\r\ndisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/668/dsmeet-com-forums-remove-forum-rules-box.user.js","style_settings":[]}
