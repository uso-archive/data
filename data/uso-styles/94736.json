{"id":94736,"name":"Harvest App Timesheet for Narrow-Width Windows","description":"UPDATED!\r\nMakes it so the timesheet is more usable for narrow-width windows.  I like to keep my timesheet windows very narrow, so it can be more like a floating little widget I can keep in the corner of my screen. This one is usable (though not necessarily pretty) down to perhaps 150px or so.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I have also gotten this working for older versions of Firefox, which don't support regex for matching rules.  In that case, you need to manually update the matching rule to something that will match your instance of Harvest.  I have gotten this to work with Midori's built-in \"user styles\" functionality as well.","user":{"id":241216,"name":"Aaron W","email":null,"paypal_email":"aaron@adubsvc.net","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"updated":"2014-03-26T22:27:31.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":117,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/94736_after.jpeg?r=1673942414","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/94736_additional_9164.jpeg?r=1673942414","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/94736_additional_9165.jpeg?r=1673942414","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/94736_additional_9166.jpeg?r=1673942414","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/94736_additional_9167.jpeg?r=1673942414"],"license":"ccbyncsa","created":"2013-11-02T22:51:36.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"harvestapp","subcategory":"harvestapp","additional_info":"Updated again 2014-03-26 -- Again a tweak to the URL matching rule.
