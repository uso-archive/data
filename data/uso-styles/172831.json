Written by Michael Cox.\r\n\r\nSimple and automatic. Changes all background colours to dark greys and blacks and sets all body text to white.\r\n\r\nWorks on uMMORPG website. Documentation is not modified because the documentation is hosted on Google Docs and making a theme for the documentation will apply to Google. To darken the documentation, use a Google Dark Mode. Additions to these theme can be written in the future to apply to only the documentation, although that trusts the developer not to change the documentation URL.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"ummorpg.net\") {\r\n/* Written by Michael Cox, June 2019 */\r\n/* Dark statuspage.io Dashboard ver 1.0 */\r\n    \r\n/* Written under Creative Commons CC-BY-4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ */\r\n/* You are free to modify, distribute, and build upon this style freely. */\r\n/* Attribution, as listed in lines 1-2, are required if using this style for your own work */\r\n\r\nbody {\r\n    background:#000;\r\n    color:#fff;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h1 a, h2 a, h3 a, h4 a, h5 a, h6 a, .widget-area .widget-title, .main-navigation ul li a {\r\n    color:#fff;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.fa-envelope::before, .fa-twitter::before {\r\n    color:#000;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbody, .widget-area .widget a {\r\n    color:#eee\r\n}\r\n\r\n.site-top-bar-right {\r\n    color:#999;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.widget-area .widget ul li {\r\n    background: #333;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/172831/ummorpg-website-dark-theme.user.js","style_settings":[]}
