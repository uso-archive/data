{"id":11998,"name":"Last.fm - Transparent Navigation Menus","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"last.fm","subcategory":"last.fm","style_tags":[],"description":"Last fm (lastFM) user navigation menus will be transparent.\r\n\r\nThis style improves page visibility, allowing you to see all the web content behind the transparency.\r\n\r\n* Thanks to user 1386 for the style 10306, upon which I got the idea for this style!\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n+ User Name (Username) selection menus (Home, Profile, Recommended, Library, Events, Settings) will be transparent.\r\n+ Menus will become more opaque when they are hovered over with the mouse cursor\r\n+ You will be able to see images and text behind the header menu (see thru) until hovered over\r\n\r\nWorks on both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3\r\nAlso works with the Painted Black built-in LastFM Style\r\n\r\nIntegrates with the following Styles:\r\nStyle 11529\r\nStyle 11902\r\n\r\nLast.FM nav menus are also known as badger dropdown lists, and consist of UL (unordered list) code segments\r\nEdit the Transparency (-moz-opacity) to your liking.  Remember, the closer to 0 you get, the more invisible translucent the menu will be, the closer to 1 you get, the more opaque!   1 is 100% opaque, and web content will not show through, 0 is 0% opaque, and will appear as if the menu is hidden!\r\nBenOnUserstyles\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.1:\r\n+ Added a new menu (global song / user options menu).  This menu appears near song tracks and looks like a small cog gear.  It allows you to view certain options such as view song, view album, listen to song...\r\n+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-11-26T21:03:00.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1736,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/11998_after.png?r=1588493039","url":"/styles/11998/last-fm-transparent-navigation-menus","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/*\r\n ________________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                     |\r\n|          Title:  |  Last.FM - Transparent Navigation Menus             |\r\n|    Description:  |  Last fm, even more awesome! transparent = Seethru  |\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                            |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  November 10, 2008                                  |\r\n|   Last Updated:  |  November 26, 2008                                  |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.1                                            |\r\n|__________________|_____________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(last.fm) \r\n{\r\n\r\n/* Normal Menu - When Clicked: */\r\n#idBadgerDropDown,\r\nUL.lfmDropDownBody\r\n{\r\n  opacity: .75 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n/* Hovered Menu - When Moused Over: */\r\n#idBadgerDropDown:hover,\r\nUL.lfmDropDownBody:hover\r\n{\r\n  opacity: .92 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
