{"id":3075,"name":"Remove 'Spoilers!' label from FAQs","description":"I was really annoyed with the 'Spoilers!' label that is obscuring some of the entries in FAQ subsection of the movie page (it might appear in other places too, I don't know) - you have to hover the mouse over the entry to make it visible. I removed the label and instead coloured the 'spoiler' entries red, so it's still easy to distinguish spoilers from non spoilers.","user":{"id":3571,"name":"V-smund","email":"vismund-cygnus@tlen.pl","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-08-02T03:02:25.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":400,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3075_after.png?r=1684742413","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-08-02T03:02:25.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"imdb","subcategory":"imdb","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"imdb.com\") {\r\n\r\n.spoiler {  background-image: none !important;\r\n            border: none !important;}\r\n\r\n.spoiler span {visibility: visible !important;\r\n               color:red !important;}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":10340,"name":"Nice...\n\nHere is what I use though:\n\n@namespac","rating":3,"created":"2008-09-17T20:50:46.000Z","author_name":"war59312","author_id":3165}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/3075/remove-spoilers-label-from-faqs.user.js","style_settings":[]}
