Unfortunately this affects not just siteschemed pages but some journal front pages as well, meaning that some (like the Fandom Wank front page) come out looking slightly odd :/  Not being terribly tech-savvy I haven't figured out how to fix this yet.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to make it only display with siteschemed pages, please do let me know.\r\n\r\nMay require a restart to completely disable after uninstall.","user":{"id":32986,"name":"Loren Leah","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2009-11-22T22:32:46.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":116,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/22772_after.png?r=1588493039","url":"/styles/22772/journalfen-sans-serif","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.journalfen.net\") {\r\n\r\ndiv, table {\r\nfont-size: 12px;\r\nfont-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\r\n}\r\n\r\n#comments {\r\nfont-size: 11px;\r\nfont-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.talk-comment {\r\nfont-size: 12px;\r\nfont-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}
