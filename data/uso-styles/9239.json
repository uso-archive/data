{"id":9239,"name":"Douban - Fixed-width Font (SimSun)","description":"By replacing default font-family's on Douban (豆瓣: www.douban.com and www.douban.net) with a Chinese Fixed-width Font (by default, SimSun, `宋体'), you can read in a proper manner all articles including programming source code or Vertical written postings generated by GuTiShuWen Transverter (http://www.cshbl.com/shuwen/shuwen.html) or its like.\r\n\r\nThis CSS is so simple that you can hack it by yourself into whatever you like with your favorite Fixed-width font on your Mac or Linux computer.\r\n\r\nIn the future I'm *NOT* making it work over the very areas that showing multi-lined text but the whole Douban site.  Whenever you hate it, just turn OFF this style with your Stylish/GreaseMonkey button on the status-bar (if you leave the button there).","user":{"id":12783,"name":"Lam Edh","email":"lamedh@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-08-12T06:00:47.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":475,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/9239_after.png?r=1676016014","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-07-31T21:16:01.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"douban","subcategory":"douban","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"douban.com\"), domain(\"douban.net\")\r\n{\r\n\r\n* {font-family: å®‹ä½“, SimSun !important }\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/9239/douban-fixed-width-font-simsun.user.js","style_settings":[]}
