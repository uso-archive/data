This script modifies websites and UI elements I've run into\r\nthat don't match whatever color scheme you're running in KDE. It makes the websites\r\nthat somehow become unreadable or weird-looking look the way they normally do (since\r\nthey aren't designed to match the OS's theme anyway) and makes the UI elements match\r\nthe KDE theme. Right now, I'm using the color scheme called Wonton Soup, so this style\r\nwill match it. You can change that by changing the color values in here to whatever\r\nyour color scheme is (for the sake of consistency, I recommend getting said color values\r\nfrom a similar element in the Firefox UI--for example, I took the colors I used for the\r\nPocket/Read-It-Later list from the Downloads sidebar).\r\n\r\nNote that I'm using openSUSE's Firefox KDE integration package, so you may need both\r\nthat package and this style to make Firefox fully match your theme. In Ubuntu and Arch,\r\nthe package's name is kmozillahelper. You may even also need oxygen-gtk (makes GTK apps\r\nmatch the KDE theme) in conjunction with these, for all I know. I do not have the Oxygen\r\nFirefox theme/persona/whatever installed, though, because I think it's ugly.\r\n\r\nWEBSITES CURRENTLY MODIFIED:\r\nAll sites (that have this issue): unreadable textboxes.\r\nmyepisodes.com: unreadable button text.\r\n\r\nUI ELEMENTS CURRENTLY MODIFIED:\r\nAllInOneSidebar's addons page: unreadable unselected list entries.\r\nPocket/Read-It-Later list: white & gray colors that don't change to match the theme. */\r\n\r\n/* Textbox colors */\r\ntextarea, input {\r\n    background-color: inherit !important;\r\n    color: inherit !important;\r\n}\r\n/* Exceptions for weird sites I've found (copy any domain or URL you want in here) */\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"userstyles.org\") {\r\n    textarea {\r\n        background-color: #ffffff !important;\r\n        color: #000000 !important;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"facebook.com\") {\r\n    .uiLinkButtonInput {\r\n        color: rgb(110, 130, 180) !important;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Button colors */\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"myepisodes.com\") {\r\n  .flatButton {\r\n    color: #000000 !important;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* AllInOneSidebar addons page */\r\n@-moz-document url(\"about:addons\") {\r\n  page[aios-inSidebar][aios-appDefTheme=\"true\"] .addon:not([selected=\"true\"]) {\r\n    background-color: rgb(60, 64, 72) !important;\r\n  }\r\n  page[aios-inSidebar][aios-appDefTheme=\"true\"] #categories {\r\n    background-color: rgb(60, 64, 72) !important;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Pocket/Read-It-Later sidebar page */\r\n@-moz-document url(\"chrome://isreaditlater/content/list.xul\") {\r\n  #RIL_list { background-color: rgb(60, 64, 72) !important; }\r\n  #RIL_list_body { background-color: rgb(60, 64, 72) !important; }\r\n  a { color: rgb(194, 205, 223) !important; }\r\n  #RIL_menu { background-color: rgb(73, 78, 88) !important; }\r\n  #RIL_chooser { background-color:  rgb(73, 78, 88) !important; }\r\n}"}
