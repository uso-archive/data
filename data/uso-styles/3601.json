{"id":3601,"name":"Fix Google Widescreen View","description":"With the latest run of Google Reader updates, I noticed that when I removed the sidebar using the toggle button between the sidebar and the main screen - I would get the scrollbar pushed out of the browser.  Looking around for a fix - I found out if you removed the toggle between the menu and body of Google Reader it would fix the problem.  Hopefully this is only a temp. fix till Google gets things corrected.  First public user style - so be nice. ;)","user":{"id":4205,"name":"Mitch","email":"cheasym@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-09-27T06:13:15.000Z","weekly_install_count":4,"total_install_count":1336,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3601_after.gif?r=1687593692","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-09-27T06:13:15.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.google.com/reader/\"), url-prefix(\"https://www.google.com/reader/\") {\r\n\r\n\r\n/* remove toggler */\r\n#nav-toggler {\r\n  display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/3601/fix-google-widescreen-view.user.js","style_settings":[]}
