Just remember that bottom of the list = bottom of the stack.\r\n\r\nYou can also make the bottom layer use a linear gradient instead with a top and bottom of equal height that is transparent if you wanted a quick and dirty banner solution. This means you can make the player look super-fancy without needing to screw with background colours. Example:\r\nlinear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 35%, black 35%, black 75%, transparent 75%, transparent 100%)\r\n\r\nThis is not limited to static images; Animations can be used, but they must be GIF, unless you're animating the entire image. Clever coders can probably find a way to use a pseudochild if they need to.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eGitHub release\u003c/b\u003e\r\nFor inclusion in your community theme, you can \u003ca href=http://hebgbs.github.io/scimg.css\u003eget it here.\u003c/a\u003e","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.dubtrack.fm\") {\r\n\r\n#room-main-player-container-soundcloud,\r\n.playerPreview .SCplayerImage{\r\n  background: url(http://i.imgur.com/tw7dOXy.png) center center/100% 100% no-repeat,\r\n/* Top layer */   /* Top image */                 /* img pos, img size, img repeat */\r\n  /* !
