{"id":80268,"name":"Trello: show card ID on hover","description":"When hovering over a card in Trello, the ID of the card appears in the bottom right corner of the card. Useful to make a link to the card. Note: on single line cards, it will be a bit hidden behind the \"edit\" crayon icon, but still visible.","user":{"id":126,"name":"Samuel Dellicour","email":"smd@samplify.be","paypal_email":"smd@samplify.be","homepage":"http://www.samplify.be","about":null,"license":"ccby"},"updated":"2015-08-31T20:41:46.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":818,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/80268_after.png?r=1679558415","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2012-12-19T07:44:08.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"trello","subcategory":"trello","additional_info":"How to make a link to a card: Let's say you want to make a link to card with number \"34\" (number visible when you hover over the card, with this user style installed). Then all you have to do is type #34 (pound sign + the number) in the description of another card, and it will automatically create a link to the first card. Note: links only work within a same board, and if you use the \"#\" for a header in a description, it will not be a link. Add any text before it to make it a link.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"trello.com\") {\r\n\r\n  .list-card:hover .card-short-id {\r\n    display: block !important;\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    right:2px;\r\n    bottom:0px;\r\n    color: #9C9C9C;\r\n    cursor: default;    \r\n    font-size: 11px;\r\n    line-height: 16px;\r\n    height: 16px;\r\n    text-decoration: none;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\n/* end */\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/80268/trello-show-card-id-on-hover.user.js","style_settings":[]}
