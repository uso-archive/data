You can also change the color of the background for these entries if you so desire.\r\nUpdate 2: banthaz figured out Omnibar, so i didn't have to. Thanks man! And yes, CC-BY has been respected. Also, revamped the bookmark color, as it looked more orange than gold. For each highlighted list item, there's a rounded border so the corners don't stick outside of the autocomplete menu.\r\nUpdate 3: Took the code from the three smaller styles I posted earlier (which are fixed by now) and combined them into this style.\r\nUpdate 4: Ermahgerd berkmerks! Typo correction.\r\n\r\nThis chimera of a style uses dotter's code from Awesome Bar Background Color Based on Type (WOW) *, my code from Awesome Bar Text based on Type and a modified version of DaedalusIcarusHelios' code from Firefox 13 - Customizations to produce the desired effect. Simplified and streamlined code is easy to read and I encourage everybody using Windows Vista and above with Aero effects to try it out.\r\n\r\nCan be combined with my \u003ca href=\"http://userstyles.org/styles/79204\"\u003edisappearing toolbars\u003c/a\u003e style. be sure to disable dotter's style and My text-only version before using this. Aero glass effect may not take effect until you restart Firefox. Also works best with defaults if you de-saturate the window border in Windows' personalization dialog.\r\n\r\nPlays very nicely with the Omnibar extension as well!\r\n\r\nIf you want only want a specific type of modification from this style, check these out!\r\n\u003ca href=\"http://userstyles.org/styles/80180\"\u003eGlass Awesome Bar\u003c/a\u003e\r\n\u003ca href=\"http://userstyles.org/styles/79980\"\u003eAwesome Bar Background Color Based on Type 2\u003c/a\u003e\r\n\u003ca href=\"http://userstyles.org/styles/80182\"\u003eAwesome Bar Text Based on Type 2\u003c/a\u003e","style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\nGlass Awesome Bar\r\n\r\nThis style assumes Vista/7 Areo default, change to your liking.\r\nDo not be afraid to modify the code, you can always undo and try again if you mess up too much. ;P\r\n\r\nCredit goes to dotter, creator of \"Awesome Bar Background Color Based on Type (WOW) *\" for the original style which inspired Awesome Bar Text based on Type\r\nAs well, DaedalusIcarusHelios, creator of \"Firefox 13 - Customizations\" for the (modified) glass awesomebar code\r\nAlso credit to banthaz, crator of \"Omnibar - Compact and Stylish\" for the Omnibar code, CC-BY; http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r\nThanks to luckymouse @ forum.userstyles.org for the \"Switch to tab\" label code.
