My work and play cross paths often since I get a lot of joy out of what I do and study, some of which are:\r\n\r\n- Perl + CPAN Developer\r\n- Linux C++ Developer (Qt4, Qt5, KDE4, KFM5, and related)\r\n- Shell Script Developer (Perl, BASH, sh, upstart, vim plugin development)\r\n- Web Style Developer (CSS, SaSS, SGML, HTML5, etc) though I do know HTML4 too [who doesn't?]\r\n- Windows C++ Developer (Old Pro in Microsoft related technologies)\r\n- Old-School Technologies (qbasic, vbdos, borland c++, ms-dos 6.66, i386 assembler /w emphasis on _some_ 64-bit stuff)\r\n- Music Hobbyist (Electronic Music Writer, Piano, Keyboard player/Enthusiast)\r\n- Graphic Artist (Pencil/Pen/Watercolor physical media, Maya/Blender/3DSMax/Bryce/Gimp/Photoshop HD and post-production)\r\n\r\nI am not currently in any group at the time. I am not sure if I will be doing that ever again. The last few groups I participated in were too incoherent and seemed to have different ideals, ethics, goals. \r\n\r\nI am open to suggestion or requests, just don't make them impossible for a single person to do. Requesting a theme have a black version is probably okay. Requesting that I personally show up and restyle your entire website is probably not. Of course, if I were getting paid to do it, that would be a whole other matter, but I rarely see people paying for such things these days when you can hire someone in another country to do it for 2 cents -- that's right I'm a bitter man :D= \u003c- those are vampire teeth!!","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2013-02-01T10:26:00.000Z","weekly_install_count":2,"total_install_count":721,"rating":5.0,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/82478_after.png?r=1687593692","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2013-02-01T10:13:49.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"littlealchemy","subcategory":"littlealchemy","additional_info":"LittleAlchemy ( LittleAlchemy.com ) ( http://www.littlealchemy.com )\r\n\r\nTested with\r\nCHROME, FIREFOX (linux versions) \r\ni didnt have a chance to test under windows but ive never had a difference so it should be fine...","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/*\r\nLittleAlchemy ( LittleAlchemy.com ) ( http://www.littlealchemy.com )\r\nversion 1.0 by Gabriel T.
