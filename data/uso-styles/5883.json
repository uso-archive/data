{"id":5883,"name":"Amazon Anywhere","description":"I got tired of Amazon's bloat - it takes forever to load, and there is just too much stuff on the screen. I tried to reduce the clutter ( style 4328 ), but that doesn't help the load time.\r\n\r\nThen I discovered Amazon has a mobile site (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw), which is virtually text-only (small icons and cover pics), and lightning-quick. Works well in a sidebar, too.\r\n\r\nI felt that it could use space a little more efficiently though. And removed a couple of categories I'm never going to use.","user":{"id":5140,"name":"timepiece","email":"debmorrissey@gmail.com","paypal_email":"debmorrissey@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-11-18T18:40:36.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":825,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/5883-after.png?r=1680854414","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-03-21T12:40:02.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"amazon","subcategory":"amazon","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw\") {\r\n\r\n/* * { max-width: 210px!important; } for sidebar/gadget use - delete otherwise */\r\nBODY { font-size: small; }\r\n\r\nHR, INPUT + BR, A + A + A + A + BR,  FONT[size=\"-1\"], \r\nIMG[alt=\"Auto\"], IMG[alt=\"Photo \"], IMG[alt=\"Sporting Goods \"], IMG[alt=\"Wireless \"], IMG[alt=\"ETC \"], IMG[alt=\"Magazines \"] { \r\n    display: none; } /* remove unnecessary elements, couple of \"stores\" */\r\n\r\nA \u003e IMG { width: 22px!important; height: 22px!important; }\r\n\r\nLEFT \u003e P:first-child { margin: -10px 0 0 0; } /* move logo up */\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/5883/amazon-anywhere.user.js","style_settings":[]}
