It's still a bit too squished but FF.net decided not to use paragraph tags.  Go figure.\r\n\r\n-Added some spacing above the box to give space between the portal (Movies -\u003eThe Avengers in this case).\r\n\r\n-Changed the size of the text controls one notch.  It seemed too big.   You can easily change this by deleting the line \"font-size: 11px;\".\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eThere is no way to completely delete the borders around the box itself.  FF.net decided not to use CSS there.  Same goes for the title or the horrible horizontal line.\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e(The fact they use tables still is annoying to me and I hate it but this is as \"pretty\" as I could get.)\u003c/i\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003eOriginal idea from Sirius.\u003c/b\u003e\r\nI merely added to it just in case picky people like me also get bothered by the horrible box they added above the stories.\r\n\r\nFeel free to edit the style to your liking.
