  "additional_info": "Here's what I did:\r\n\r\n-Deleted that HORRIBLE blue border that was on the box.\r\n\r\n-Added in the light grey (yes, it's grey, it just seems blue) for the area text controls instead of white because it had no sense of separation.\r\n\r\n-Added some line-height to the table that holds the title, description, and everything down to the content adjustments to give some more space since it was terribly squished.  It's still a bit too squished but FF.net decided not to use paragraph tags.  Go figure.\r\n\r\n-Added some spacing above the box to give space between the portal (Movies ->The Avengers in this case).\r\n\r\n-Changed the size of the text controls one notch.  It seemed too big.   You can easily change this by deleting the line \"font-size: 11px;\".\r\n\r\n<b>There is no way to completely delete the borders around the box itself.  FF.net decided not to use CSS there.  Same goes for the title or the horrible horizontal line.</b>\r\n\r\n<i>(The fact they use tables still is annoying to me and I hate it but this is as \"pretty\" as I could get.)</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<b>Original idea from Sirius.</b>\r\nI merely added to it just in case picky people like me also get bothered by the horrible box they added above the stories.\r\n\r\nFeel free to edit the style to your liking.  W3schools.com is the perfect place to learn CSS.  It's pretty easy to learn.</blockquote>",
