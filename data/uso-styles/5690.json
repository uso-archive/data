{"id":5690,"name":"about.com-decaf makes about.com forums readable","description":"\r\n\r\nWARNING! This style is being discontinued. You can use the search function to look for a host of scripts I am creating for about.com. As about.com is performing changes to their layout it is becoming a pain to keep all fixes in a single file. Instead, I am moving most of the changes into individual scripts which are easier to maintain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVersion 0.1\r\n\r\nThis style for about.com forums is my first; it was created because the glaring large white areas are bad on the eyes, the font is too small with too little contrast, the message is area too narrow etc.\r\n\r\nThis style addresses these issues; it has a coffee-and-milk colour theme, and it must be decaf because it removes many unwanted items ;). \r\n\r\nScreenshots in real size:\r\nhttp://www.nyboria.de/images/pre-decaf.jpg\r\nhttp://www.nyboria.de/images/post-decaf.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate to version 0.2: Lighter background, better contrast, removal of grey text, some further color changes.\r\n\r\nUpdate to version 0.3: no functional changes, but added comments and changed the sequence to make customizing the style easier for you.\r\n\r\nUpdate to version 0.4: the previous versions proved not to be invertible; not all elements would gracefully convert when settings were made for a dark background with light foreground. 0.4 addresses that. Conversion still isn't perfect, especially as some icons and images used on the forums presuppose a light (actually white) background. You'll want to set the foreground color not too light, or you will not be able to see some of the elements in message windows and the editor.\r\n\r\nUpdate to version 0.4.1: Just a small added function: remove the maximum height for signatures, so signatures don't get cut off at 500 px. They may also be as wide as possible now, no artifical width restriction anymore. You can decrease the maximum-height, too, if those giant signatures bug you. \r\n\r\nUpdate to version 0.4.2: no additional functionality, but as about.com have now wisely given in to the demands of users who wanted the avatars on top of the message rather than have them waste space to the left, the code for removing the avatars has now been dropped from the script. If you do not upgrade (or remove the code yourself) you will not see who sent a message anymore.\r\nThe update is not perfect, there's a bit of border missing, but as about.com is going to change even more things in the near future I am not going to remedy small design errors, just keep functionality alive. I suppose once the amendment of the redesign is finished I'll whip up a new script to make the forums (and possibly the whole site design) editable.\r\n\r\nUpdate to 0.4.3: search boxes were set to white text on white background, this update remedies that and leaves input boxes alone in the editor. This might cause trouble when you try to invert the color scheme, but such inversions are probably more hassle than it is worth anyway. With the exception of actual usability bugs like this one decaf will not be developed further; instead I will concentrate on individual fixes to about.com design blunders like the avatar fix already available here: http://userstyles.org/styles/7654 .\r\n\r\nOr maybe the programmers in question will see the light and fix things themselves... ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nA word of caution:\r\n\r\nMake sure that you save a self-edited style under a different name, so that your changes do not get overwritten with the next update.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","user":{"id":6742,"name":"bitpicker","email":"bitpicker@compuserve.de","paypal_email":"robinpfeifer@web.de","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-06-05T01:41:22.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":398,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/5690-after.png?r=1683792013","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-03-13T10:23:11.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"about","subcategory":"about","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":" /*\r\n   Welcome to the Decaf style for about.com forums, version 0.4!\r\n\r\n   This is a style for the Stylish extension for the Firefox browser.\r\n   It is supposed to make the forums more easily readable.
