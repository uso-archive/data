{"id":10324,"name":"IMDB (set back to 100% width)","description":"www.imdb.com recently updated their website with a modified design putting the pages into a fixed width.\r\n\r\nThat's all very well, but i like viewing this particular website at 100% width.\r\n\r\nUse the following small style to get it back to 100% width.\r\n\r\nScreenshots not provided as it's such a small code, i'll include screenshots if i decide to start changing the rest of the look.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Removal of top ads etc... minor change...\r\n\r\nCode tested regarding trailer page, seems to work fine now.... The original trailer was larger then normal, i can see the IMDB have resized their trailers and the problem has gone as a result.","user":{"id":14196,"name":"t31os","email":"t31os_@ntlworld.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-11-15T02:59:50.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":2036,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/10324-after.png?r=1687420883","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-09-05T14:53:31.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"imdb","subcategory":"imdb","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"imdb.com\") \r\n{div#root, table.outerbody, table#outerbody {width:100%!important;}\r\n[id*='swf_UK_Supertab'], iframe#top_ad {display:none!important;}\r\ncenter {width:0!important}\r\n#wrapper {background-image:none!important}\r\ndiv#main {width:auto!important;float:left!important}\r\ndiv#sidebar {width:auto!important;float:right!important}\r\ndiv#header {width:100%!important}\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":10242,"name":"Does what it says.
