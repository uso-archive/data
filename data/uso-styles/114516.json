After noticing that many of the sites I use regularly didn't have any dark styles (or any styles at all for that matter), I decided to upload my own for any other sufferers (or just anyone else who likes a darker look) to use. \r\n\r\nHowever, I am in no way an expert. I am aware that most of my styles are far from perfect, but they work for what I use them for. I learned a lot of what I know from just looking at other people's styles I've used in the past; as such, everyone is welcome to make whatever changes are needed to my styles to suit their own usage/tastes (if you need help, just ask).\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has contributed to this great utility, and eternal thanks to Stylish for being exactly what lets me enjoy the web!\r\n\r\nPS. I use the FT DeepDark theme and styles for Firefox by Steva/Sr21, so my dark color scheme is similar to that (although I make mine a touch darker). If you want different colors, everything should be easily changeable.","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2016-08-09T15:03:53.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":59,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/114516_after.png?r=1587629086","url":"/styles/114516/tumblr-vixx-starlight-hangul-logo-nova","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(http://www.tumblr.com/), url-prefix(https://www.tumblr.com/){\r\n\r\n.logo .svg-logo \r\n{background: url('http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v24/novadestin/vixxstarlight.png') no-repeat;\r\nwidth: 185px;\r\nmargin-left: 2px;\r\nmargin-top: -1px;}\r\n\r\ng#main-logo \r\n{display: none;}\r\n\r\n}"}
