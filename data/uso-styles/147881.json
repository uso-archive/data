To hide pins and roads, disable this style, open the menu on the left side and select \"labels on\", which will disable them. Afterwards, you can re-enable this style to see Google Maps with no distractions.","user":{"id":410662,"name":"Xane Myers (Xane_MM)","email":"xanem1@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"https://sites.google.com/view/xanem1","about":"I'm the developer of Magical Mary 1!
