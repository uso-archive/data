But now the Video does not minimize again if you click on the other screen.\r\n\r\nHope this might be useful.\r\n\r\nTips: Press F11 to set fullscreen mode of your browser.\r\n\r\nby Fred","user":{"id":274253,"name":"fo321meins","email":"fo321meins@googlemail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2016-02-07T13:59:38.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":743,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/105569_after.jpeg?r=1678003216","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2014-09-20T15:57:39.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"sky","subcategory":"sky","additional_info":"--2016-02-07: Fixed Chrome Bug","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.skygo.sky.de\") {\r\n #playerContainerId\r\n {\r\n   top: 0 !important;\r\n   left: 0 !important;\r\n   position: absolute !important;\r\n   z-index: 9999 !important;\r\n   width: 1920px !important;\r\n   height: 1080px !important;\r\n }\r\n #PolymediaShowPlayer\r\n {\r\n   width: 1920px !important;\r\n   height: 1080px !important;\r\n }\r\n #playerContainerId_inner\r\n {\r\n   width: 1920px !important;\r\n   height: 1080px !important;\r\n }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/105569/fix-for-sky-go-de-1080p-fullscreen-with-dualscreen.user.js","style_settings":[]}
