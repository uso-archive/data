I can see how it might benefit some, but for a user who is resistant to change and susceptible to headaches from too wide spacing, this is a huge bother. So this style opts to change the line-heights and the margins of the dashboard. \r\n\r\nIf I've missed anything that needs re-spacing or anything, please let me know as soon as possible so I can modify accordingly!\r\n\r\nV1.0: The initial release, 1st Feb 2015.","style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.tumblr.com/\"), url-prefix(\"https://www.tumblr.com/\") {\r\np { line-height: 19px !important; }\r\np { margin-top: 0px !important; margin-bottom: 8px !important; }\r\nli { line-height: 19px !important; }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/109998/tumblr-text-space-style.user.js","style_settings":[]}
