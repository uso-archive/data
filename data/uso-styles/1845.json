  "description": "Simple script that doesn't seem to break the section links on the left navbar.  Removes the ads in the middle of articles and a few on the main page (on some pages I think); it also centers the text in the login box, because I like the way centered text looks.  I've only tested it on insider.ign.com.  Let me know how it works for you; suits my purposes just fine.",
