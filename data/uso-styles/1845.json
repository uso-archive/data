{"id":1845,"name":"IGN No Ads","description":"Simple script that doesn't seem to break the section links on the left navbar.  Removes the ads in the middle of articles and a few on the main page (on some pages I think); it also centers the text in the login box, because I like the way centered text looks.  I've only tested it on insider.ign.com.  Let me know how it works for you; suits my purposes just fine.","user":{"id":1869,"name":"The Ev","email":"evan.sherwood+openid@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-02-19T18:35:01.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1602,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/1845_after.gif?r=1678003216","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-02-19T18:35:01.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"ign","subcategory":"ign","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/* Written by The Ev for his own purposes because he was annoyed with IGN ads */\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"ign.com\") {\r\n\r\n#MediumRectangleAd, #BillboardAd, #ad-wrap, #leaderboardAd, #HalfPageAd {display: none !important;}\r\n\r\n#loginBox {\r\ntext-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":7818,"name":"Beautiful","rating":3,"created":"2008-03-06T21:48:07.000Z","author_name":"Kevin82485","author_id":6589}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/1845/ign-no-ads.user.js","style_settings":[]}
