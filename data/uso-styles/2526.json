{"id":2526,"name":"printing style for \"The Definite Guide to symfony\"","description":"What if you have already purchased a copy of \"The Definite Guide to symfony\" but your colleagues at work and your friends keep borrowing it so that you never really have it hand when you need it? Now you can get the book in a printer friendly way:\r\n\r\n* no navigation buttons since they cannot be clicked from within the printed version anyway\r\n* no navigation box to use its space for the actual documentation\r\n* no user comments\r\n* lighter background colors to save your printer from spitting too much ink\r\n* using the full range of the page from left to right to keep the amount of pages being printed small\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are also a few things that went awry:\r\n\r\n* pre-tags will not be wrapped by page limits and so it may occur that some lines containing source code or command line input will not be fully printed since they exeed the printing page frame. You may adjust this however by your printing options.\r\n* Some images are really big and you might wish to scale them down a bit in order to save ink. Regrettably firefox didn't grant my wish to edit the size of a single image qualified by its source attribute like img[src~=F0301.jpg]. So I left all images unscaled.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this style is only useful if you want to print the page. Browsing is more fun with the original style.","user":{"id":2912,"name":"Elemmire","email":"elemmire@ossiriand.de","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-06-13T02:05:03.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":119,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/2526_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-06-07T11:15:59.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"symfony-project","subcategory":"symfony-project","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.symfony-project.com/book/trunk\") {\r\n\r\n#footer, #bar, .weblog_comment, #header, #navigation, #topseparator\r\n{\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntable#topbar h1\r\n{\r\n    padding-top: 16px !important;\r\n    background-color: #eee !important;\r\n    color: #000 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntable#topbar h2\r\n{\r\n    background-color: #eee !important;\r\n    color: #000 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#content1, .documentation\r\n{\r\n    margin: 0px !important;\r\n    font-size: 1.2em !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.documentation pre\r\n{\r\n    background-color: #fafafa !important;\r\n    overflow: visible !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.documentation pre.command-line\r\n{\r\n    background-color: #eee !important;\r\n    color: #000 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.documentation blockquote.sidebar\r\n{\r\n    background-color: #eee !important;\r\n    color: #000 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.documentation blockquote.sidebar p\r\n{\r\n    background-color: #eee !important;\r\n    color: #000 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.documentation blockquote.sidebar p.title\r\n{\r\n    background-color: #ddd !important;\r\n    color: #fff !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/2526/printing-style-for-the-definite-guide-to-symfony.user.js","style_settings":[]}
