  "additional_info": "Like the epilogues, Homestuck^2 is text heavy, which can make it difficult to process all of the text.  So, I wrote a few lines of CSS to make it comic sans, which is much easier to read, like my <a href=\"https://userstyles.org/styles/171012/comic-sans-homestuck-epilogue\">epilogue comic sans theme.</a>\r\nLike my epilogue comic sans theme, feel free to grab this CSS and change it around to suit your personal needs, it took me like 5 minutes to write.\r\n\r\nIf this CSS makes the site display in cursive, you need to install comic sans or swap fonts.",
