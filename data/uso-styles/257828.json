{"result":{"id":257828,"name":"Custom Avatars Style","description":"I noticed the custom avatar styles on here weren't active during battles, so I fixed that and also made  it into a change where people can add their own pictures and modify existing trainer sprites to which ones they want. There is an example code to modify at your own use with notes to help. If you need any more help feel free to add me on discord @DodgetheStorm#9724. Have fun!","category":"site","url":"/styles/257828/custom-avatars-style","created":"2023-01-19T03:43:08.000Z","updated":"2023-09-07T08:30:36.000Z","rating":4,"screenshotUrl":"https://assets.userstyles.org/assets_packs/type=style/user_id=3333836/screenshot_0f7505e3-c1c8-4dd8-8424-b6a5b2b37014.webp","user":{"name":"DodgetheStorm","paypalEmail":null,"id":3333836,"photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AEdFTp7mUFK3IKBoeEBGv6k3uLjkTI3WgWmO94Emx7176A=s96-c"},"subcategory":"pokemonshowdown","isPremium":false,"weeklyInstallsCount":3,"totalInstallsCount":705,"md5":"722f2982e9564b60b8226bfdfb94120b","notes":null,"license":null,"obsolete":false,"exampleUrl":"https://play.pokemonshowdown.com","afterScreenshotName":"https://assets.userstyles.org/assets_packs/type=style/user_id=3333836/screenshot_0f7505e3-c1c8-4dd8-8424-b6a5b2b37014.webp","tags":[]}}
