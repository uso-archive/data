{"id":24319,"name":"Xbox - Compact Friends","description":"I only use the page as a convenient way keep track of my Xbox-friends, and thus - on this page only - I've minimalized it significantly. Mouse-over details still work as before.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't a U.S. native English-speaker, you may have to change the domain in userstyle code to your friend page accordingly for this to work for you. I apologize for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\nAs always, do check out my Youtube channel and Steam group. Do add me as a friend, subscribe, or even just leave comments! You can also follow me on twitter.\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/N0Lif3\r\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/Stockton/\r\nhttp://twitter.com/N0Lif3","user":{"id":22383,"name":"N0Lif3","email":"N0Lif3@comcast.net","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"updated":"2010-01-19T16:40:20.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":799,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/24319_after.png?r=1687334486","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-01-19T16:37:13.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"xbox","subcategory":"xbox","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url(\"http://live.xbox.com/en-US/profile/Friends.aspx\") {\r\n\r\ndiv#ctl00__shellTop,\r\ndiv#ctl00__subheaderControl_linkContainer, \r\ndiv.XbcChrome, \r\ndiv#ctl00__shellFooterContainer,\r\ndiv.XbcShellNavSubHeader\r\n{display:none !important}\r\n\r\n.XbcShellMainFlare{background-image:none !important; background-color: #000 !important}\r\n\r\ntr.XbcTableFriendOffline td {\r\nbackground-color:#191919 !important;}\r\n\r\n* {color: #00bb00 !important; border: none !important}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/24319/xbox-compact-friends.user.js","style_settings":[]}
