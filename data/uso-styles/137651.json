{"id":137651,"name":"Old School Youtube Player Bar","description":"-This Style makes a colored player bar below the video instead of over it.\r\n-What I actually did was make the video background lower than the video, and set a color. You might see the custom color on the sides of the video, so I made it a gradient, so most of it is black. (Ask if you want it to be turned into a rainbow of colors) :3\r\n\r\n-Note: Unfortunately the video suggestions on the side are moved down with the player, I can fix this, but it wrecks Cinema mode. :/\r\n\r\n-The Bar should work at almost any aspect ratio, (but my brother figured out how to break it) :P\r\n\r\n-This bar is not visible during full-screen, sorry... I gotta research how to auto hide the bar if it is overlaid over the video for this.\r\n\r\n-I set a default hidden Shadow Style, but you can customise the shadow gradient for the top and bottom with my other style: style 135027","user":{"id":364903,"name":"Joseph Dickson","email":"josephgdickson@gmail.com","paypal_email":"josephgdickson@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":"I'm a lousy coder, total novice! but I've learned only basically how to hide elements through being annoyed by them. :3","license":"ccby"},"updated":"2017-04-23T13:36:18.000Z","weekly_install_count":3,"total_install_count":2174,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/137651_after.jpeg?r=1687593612","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/137651_additional_24187.jpeg?r=1687593612","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/137651_additional_24188.jpeg?r=1687593612","https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/137651_additional_24190.jpeg?r=1687593612"],"license":"publicdomain","created":"2017-01-14T09:51:41.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"youtube","subcategory":"youtube","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://www.youtube.com/\") {\r\n/* Remove Shadow on YouTube Video Player Bar*/\r\n/*setting the opacity of player gradient*/\r\n#movie_player \u003e div.ytp-gradient-bottom {opacity: 0.4;}\r\n#movie_player \u003e div.ytp-gradient-top {opacity: 0.1;}\r\n/*set the color of YouTube Video background (linear gradient instead)*/\r\n#movie_player {background: linear-gradient(black, black, black, black, black, /*[[PLAYRGB]]*/); height: 109% !important;}\r\n/*moving verious elements to lower the Player Bar below the video*/\r\n#movie_player \u003e div.html5-video-container \u003e video {height: 120%;}\r\n#movie_player \u003e div.html5-video-player {height: 130% !important;}\r\n#placeholder-player {margin-bottom: 4%;}\r\n/*theater mode fix*/\r\n#movie_player \u003e div.html5-video-container \u003e video {top: 0px !important;}\r\n}\r\n","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/137651/old-school-youtube-player-bar.user.js","style_settings":[{"id":455587,"style_id":137651,"install_key":"PLAYRGB","label":"Set Color of Player Bar (background of video)","ordinal":0,"setting_type":"color","style_setting_options":[{"id":1639612,"style_setting_id":455587,"label":"placeholder","value":"#332922","default":true,"ordinal":0,"install_key":"placeholder"}]}]}
