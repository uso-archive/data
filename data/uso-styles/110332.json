Tumblr marks it with a helpful \"#tags\".\r\n\r\nHowever, it's displayed in a slightly wrong color in a slightly wrong position and it's sometimes there even after you wrote your tag! That's annoying for me, and probably quite nerve-wracking for OCD people.\r\n\r\nThis userstyle should fix all those problems by:\r\n- correcting the color\r\n- making sure the \"#tags\" hint disappears whenever there's an actual tag\r\n\r\nIn the screenshot(s) you can see:\r\n- top: Original, with tag \"#tags\" and the \"#tags\" prompt side-by-side. As you can see: It's not aligned and different colors. Horrible! And the prompt probably shouldn't be there anyway.\r\n- bottom left: With my style, before entering a new tag\r\n- bottom right: With my style, after (not while) entering a tag.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"tumblr.com\") {\r\n  /* Select the \"#tags\" prompt ONLY IF there's an actual tag before it. */\r\n  span.tag-label ~ div.tag-input-wrapper \u003e\r\n  [data-name=\"tagInput\"] \u003e .editor-wrapper \u003e .editor-slot \u003e div.editor-placeholder {\r\n    display: none;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* ===== Hey, you!
