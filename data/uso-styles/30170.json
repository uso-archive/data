{"id":30170,"name":"Extend Google Results Page","description":"Like the new Google layout, but hate how it squishes everything into that small space? This style helps those of us using multiple columns of results or the Googlepedia addon (though Googlepedia may have been fixed recently, I do not know), by expanding the area for the results.\r\n\r\nSize not right?  Just change the value in the script to exactly what works for you.\r\n\r\n*Update*\r\nShould now work on searches directly from the Google main page.  If it doesn't, post the userscript or addon that you want to make work and I'll edit it.","user":{"id":50155,"name":"PiiSPii","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2010-07-20T13:20:15.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":344,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":null,"obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2010-05-14T18:56:38.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.google.ca\"), domain(\"www.google.com\"), domain(\"www.google.co.uk\"), domain(\"www.google.com.au\") {\r\n\r\n#ires {\r\nwidth: 1450px !important;\r\n      }\r\n\r\nspan[id=\"search\"], #multi_column_view {\r\nwidth: 1450px !important;\r\n      }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/30170/extend-google-results-page.user.js","style_settings":[]}
