{"id":44901,"name":"Youtube - Remove Ads","description":"Since Google Inc. is operating Youtube we'd noticed that there are more and more ad positions. Because of my small screen it forces me to scroll down if I want to see the related videos. For that reason I wrote some simple custom css styles to hide them. They'll be loaded anyway but you won't see them anymore. So, don't worry: Google will get the money for your view as well ;-)\r\n\r\nNote: The video ads and the ads inside the player can't be hidden by CSS!","user":{"id":92181,"name":"the_Ben","email":"b.unruh@cmbd.de","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2011-03-06T10:22:19.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":5568,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/44901_after.jpeg?r=1683360012","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2011-03-06T10:22:19.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"youtube","subcategory":"youtube","additional_info":"Just add a new style to your stylish config and paste the code!\r\n\r\nVersion: 1.0\r\nCreated: 2011/03/06\r\n\r\nIf there are still ads, I've forgotten just write down a comment.
