It also, disable the MOTM to change the color of members links and makes them always stay a certain color. This works on all pages throughout the site. And it also, makes it a little wider, so you won't be wasting any screen real estate. it will work as long as your monitor is 1024px wide or more and it will also decrease vertical scroll because it will allow fewer line breaks.","user":{"id":32520,"name":"josephbc","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-11-23T00:19:36.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":161,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/22775_after.gif?r=1686038412","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-11-23T00:19:36.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"createblog","subcategory":"createblog","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"createblog.com\") {\r\n\r\n\r\nspan{\r\ncolor:#222222 !Important;\r\n}\r\n#ipbwrapper, #container{\r\nwidth:1000px !Important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#logo, #footer{\r\ndisplay:none !Important;\r\n}\r\n#nav, #header{\r\npadding-top:25px !Important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/22775/createblog-minimilism.user.js","style_settings":[]}
