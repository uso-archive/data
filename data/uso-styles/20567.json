{"id":20567,"name":"imagevenue.com - Remove useless overlays","description":"Everytime i open an image hosted at imagevenue.com the image is overlayed with an information that i need to accept the TOS. Maybe it’s a bug, or the fact, that i do not save any cookies. Whatever it is, it is annoying, so i decided to create an user style, that removes the overlay.\r\n\r\nAnother useless overlay is the one showing an ad from   s t r e a m m a t e .  c o m   that is annoying, too.\r\n\r\nThis user style removes them both.\r\n\r\nEdit 2010-02-22: The new donate for Haiti overlay got removed now, too. (I guess that i see it all the time is because i’m ot accepting cookies from ImageVenue)","user":{"id":14724,"name":"Dirk_","email":"userstyles@kamerastars.org","paypal_email":"webmaster@jana-pallaske.net","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2010-02-22T15:52:03.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":377,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":null,"obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-08-29T13:39:14.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"imagevenue","subcategory":"imagevenue","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"imagevenue.com\") {\r\n\r\ndiv#overlaybg, div#ajax_load_indicator,\r\ndiv[id*=\"dtemplate13\"],\r\ndiv[id*=\"inter\"]\r\n {\r\n  visibility: hidden !important;\r\n  display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/20567/imagevenue-com-remove-useless-overlays.user.js","style_settings":[]}
