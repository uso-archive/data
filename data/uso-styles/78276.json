{"id":78276,"name":"Google - Simple background image code","description":"\u003ci\u003eI am trying to remain the most current Google style available! I've figured out how to make it more friendly toward the use of dark images, so feel free to use whatever you like.

Have fun with this style, and tweak it to your preferences.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eProblems?

Otherwise, the ride's still rough and it'll still be some time before the dust settles.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\r\nI created a new style for those looking to modify the top bar in search results!

I made this style free-of-charge for study and reuse. If you want more people to know about this, then feel free to bring this to the attention of your local media! I am sure tech blogs are itching to create an article on how to re-introduce Google background images, and this is it! Be sure to spread the word; Can we get this to 5,000 installations?\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eIf you know a web admin doesn't want hotlinking or any other bullcrap like that, don't use their image directly; Save it, then use from local filesystem or encode it in base64.\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\r\nAdditional features of this style:\r\n\r\n* Styles the footer bar to match the header bar\r\n* \u003cs\u003eRemoves the Google logo (because I don't know how to replace it, and it looks cleaner)\u003c/s\u003e \u003ci\u003eSee update 2\u003c/i\u003e\r\n* \u003cs\u003eAdds padding to fill out the bottom\u003c/s\u003e \u003ci\u003eSee update 8\u003c/i\u003e\r\n* \u003cs\u003eAdds color-matched border at the header and footer, for that awesome pinstripe look.\u003c/s\u003e This means nothing anymore, but you can kind of get that back with the dark header style linked further up.\r\n\r\nUpdate 1:\r\n* Adds text color property for text below the seatch bar (hopefully for both images and search)\r\n* Colors links below the search bar\r\n* Adds text shadow property to make the Google account username better stand out in dark backgrounds.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2:\r\n* Lifts restriction on Google logo, because of another style I found that addresses this issue. \u003ca href=\"http://userstyles.org/styles/69292/google-logo-changer\"\u003eSee here.\u003c/a\u003e\r\n\r\nUpdate 3:\r\nMaintenance fix, added new ID for Google Search/Images\r\n\r\nUpdate 4:\r\nFixed image displaying in search results by swapping ID #gsr for class .hp\r\n\r\nUpdate 5:\r\nThanks Sonny for the regexp string! I was having a hard time figuring that out. Updating this style because Google Drive / Docs uses class gb on the very top. Wanted to fix that so Google Docs didn't show the background image there. left the old code in for people who want to reverse the change.\r\n\r\nUpdate 6:\r\nAdded Google Images and Google Play to the list, forgot to fix that. Basically, re-introducing some old behaviors for people who want that. And more code comments.\r\n\r\nUpdate 7:\r\nImpulse update to replace the URL -- Luckily I had it on my computer as my desktop wallpaper!\r\n\r\nUpdate 8:\r\nMaintenance fix, I somehow missed that Google changed their site code AGAIN, so I decided to update the code to accommodate these changes. Hopefully I broke nothing. #footer is now .fbar and the padding is removed.\r\nAlso, found the source image on DeviantArt!\r\n\r\nThis style was made on a 1600*900 screen, so if there are issues on smaller (or larger) resolutions, do leave a comment.\r\nI made sure the inline code comments holds the hands of newbies. If you enjoy this and want it everywhere, look into using a portable copy of Firefox with Stylish Sync.\r\n\r\nUpdate 9:\r\nImage location reverted as it was in update 7. Sorry for the fails!\r\n\r\nImage \u003ci\u003eGalactic Fractal\u003c/i\u003e created by Nathen Smith. \u003ca href=http://nmsmith.deviantart.com/art/Galactic-Fractal-53048529\u003eAvailable via DeviantArt!\u003c/a\u003e\r\n\r\nUpdate 10:\r\nCaught the new rollout early! Also, any code to become useless in the future has [L] in the comments to express legacy code. Everything should still work for people who did not get the new rollout yet.\r\n\r\nUpdate 11:\r\nModified some comments to be more user-friendly for newbs, and found the white icons in Google's default image set, therefore making the style \u003cspan\u003e100%\u003c/span\u003e dark background friendly.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nUpdate 12:\r\nThe \"F*** it, ship it\" update. This is the last update log I will place here, see the code for more information. Basically, more comments, code for Google international, and a bigger, badder regexp string that is dedicated to affecting only the Google Images and Google Search front pages.\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eEdit:\u003c/b\u003e Since update 13, I discovered that the regexp string \u003ci\u003edoesn't\u003c/i\u003e apply when clicking on the Google link in the header.
