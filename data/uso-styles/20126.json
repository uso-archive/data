{"id":20126,"name":"TeamXbox forum: Dynamic width","description":"With this style, the forum width is restricted by your browser window viewport width, not the set 1000px as per usual.\r\nImages will be full-size but restricted to 1024px (instead of 552px) wide(change this if your res. is lower/higer). I couldn't get images to scale dynamically with any resolution. Ideally they should be full-size and downscale if they don't fit the post width. People should really only post, idk, \u003c 500kB 1280x800 screenshots and link to the full-size to make it easier for everyone anyway.\r\n\r\nUse style 19140 if you want to keep the forums the same, but keep the ability to scale images.","user":{"id":25441,"name":"WataKKo","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2011-12-17T03:56:26.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":382,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/20126_after.png?r=1679126414","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-08-11T09:52:15.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"teamxbox","subcategory":"teamxbox","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"forum.teamxbox.com\") \r\n\r\n{\r\n\r\n#container\r\n{\r\n  background: #e7e7e7 !important;\r\n  min-width:1000px !important;\r\n  width: 95% !important;\r\n  border-left:solid 5pt black;\r\n  border-right:solid 5pt black\r\n}\r\n#bodycontainer\r\n{\r\n  width: auto !important;\r\n}\r\n#leftcolumn\r\n{\r\n  float: left !important;\r\n  width: 99% !important;\r\n  padding-left: 10px !important;\r\n}\r\n/* This does display, but not how I want to and I don't use it, so I've removed it */\r\n#rightcolumn\r\n{\r\ndisplay:none\r\n}\r\n/* Not working how I want it to.
