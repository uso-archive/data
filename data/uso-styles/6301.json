{"id":6301,"name":"Zap2it - cleaned and resized","description":"I knew practically nothing about CSS before last month, then Zap2it pushed me over the edge by forcing me to see ABC's listings (which is not in my favorites) at the top of the grid - with an irritating background image included. Anyway, this style sheet gives a more usable 6-hour grid by increasing the width and removing the rest of the stuff that I don't use and don't want.\r\n\r\nSee the comments in the code for more information.\r\n\r\nAlso note, I've been using Firefox 1.5 until a few months ago (Dec. '08) and it correctly displayed the sizes of boxes in the grid. Then I upgraded to version 3.04 and the boxes for different stations vary in size, leading to them not line up properly with the grid times. I have yet to investigate to see if newer versions of Firefox fix this problem, but I have been using this style sheet in Opera (9.5 beta) instead as it works properly. (Update June '10: using Firefox 3.6 now and they're displayed properly again.)","user":{"id":7562,"name":"eupeptic","email":"newbie61@hotmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2011-06-05T00:33:45.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1400,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/6301_after.gif?r=1686729615","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-04-08T06:13:17.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"zap2it","subcategory":"zap2it","additional_info":"2011-06-05: minor change that removes a station that appears at the top of the grid for advertising purposes.\r\n\r\n2011-03-05: removed ABC's forced favorite.\r\n\r\n2010-12-27: removed HGTV's forced favorite.\r\n\r\n2010-06-02: removed the ad bar in the grid.\r\n\r\n2009-09-15: removed NBC's forced favorite and part of their pop-over ad.\r\n\r\n2009-05-12: modified to account for the change in layout (aside from having the grid centered).\r\n\r\n2008-09-01: last month I removed wrapperTop  and wrapperLeft as they were no longer being used, but now the ads are back and in full force.
