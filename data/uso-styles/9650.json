{"id":9650,"name":"Link Alert Extension - Transparent Mouse Icons","description":"When hovering over a \"special link\" (ie. a .EXE file), the Link Alert icon will be transparent, allowing you to see web content behind it.\r\n\r\nObviously, you must have the Firefox Add-on \"Link Alert\" installed (installer link below)\r\n\r\n* Thanks to user 6431 for introducing me into the realm of Transparency with style 6771\r\n\r\nYou can Customize the amount of transparency by editing the Opacity in the code (Closer to 0 is closer to invisible, whereas closer to 1 is closer to fully-visible - EXAMPLE: 0.5 is in the middle of opacity)  Currently, the code has it at .8 see-thru (which means it is 20% transparent and 80% opaque)\r\n\r\nThis makes your Link Alerts easier to see behind, allowing you to view all the web page content without moving your mouse, blocking the text or images!\r\n\r\nApplies to:\r\n+ Hovering over any content type of link (https brings up a lock, .js extension shows a javascript icon, new window shows a window...)\r\n+ Transparency on your mouse notification area for each link's file extension or certain Protocols\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.\r\n+ This style is FULLY customizable, and you can set the transparency to be almost invisible, almost opaque or anything in between!\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n+ Works on Firefox3\r\n+ Works on Firefox 2\r\n\r\nIntegrates with the following Styles:\r\n+ Style 8818\r\n\r\n** Must have the Link Alert Extension installed on Firefox ( http://linkalert.googlepages.com/ )\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.1\r\n+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"benbenben3@msn.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-11-28T15:00:15.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1032,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/9650_after.png?r=1687248027","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-08-13T13:37:49.000Z","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n ___________________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                        |\r\n|          Title:  |  Link Alert Extension - Transparent Icons              |\r\n|    Description:  |  When hovering over a special link, alerts are see-thru|\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                               |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  August 13, 2008                                       |\r\n|   Date Updated:  |  November 28, 2008                                     |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.1                                               |\r\n|__________________|________________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#linkalert-icon-1,\r\n#linkalert-box\r\n{\r\n  opacity: .8 !important;\r\n  -moz-border-radius: 0px 0px 1px 1px !important;\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":8245,"name":"Not vital, but really neat-o.
