This might be a relatively common setup for people who want to have 1:1 1080p video on the cheap, as I was able to get away with this with some unit preference tinkering.\r\n\r\nEspecially handy for couch-surfing YouTube. This doesn't affect streaming chat however, which is a planned update. Any improvements can be left as comments on this style, so contribute as you wish.\r\n\r\n<b>Bugs</b>\r\n\"Read more\" appear on comments which are four lines long in their containers, which is an unexpected side effect I discovered after uploading this style. A workaround for this is being researched.",
