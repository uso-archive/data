{"id":7952,"name":"GMail 2 Remove the star system","description":"This style removes four things concerning the starred/unstarred elements:\r\n  1) it removes the column with the picture of a star in the list of messages;\r\n  2) it removes the 'starred' line in the menu;\r\n  3) it removes the star at the top of the message when reading the whole message;\r\n  4) it removes the 'starred' and 'unstarred' selectors.\r\n\r\nThe style is customizable; read carefully below.\r\n\r\nTwo method are provided forremoving the column. The method 1 (default) allows you to set the exact empty width you want to keep between the checkbox and the author of the message. Just edit the style and look for some \"width: 4px\" text under the \"Method 1\" section and put there the exact value you want. The method 2 removes the column and leaves no horizontal space. If you are interested by the second method, you must comment the first method and uncomment the second one.\r\n\r\nWarning: it is not possible with stylish to remove ONLY the two last comas in the line of selectors. Removing two selectors and leaving the comas would be ugly. For that reason, the style hides all the comas. If you don't like that, you may want to keep the whole line. Just edit the style and comment the last section of the style.\r\nYou may use this style with the following one:\r\nstyle 7876\r\nfor removing the whole line of selectors.","user":{"id":11025,"name":"Thomas Baruchel","email":null,"paypal_email":"baruchel@zenbe.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-06-13T02:56:28.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":795,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/7952-after.png?r=1687507280","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-06-13T02:10:52.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"mail.google.com\") {\r\n\r\n/*\r\n   Method 1: remove the picture of the star and keep the\r\n   empty column with the exact width you want in order to\r\n   leave some horizontal white space between the checkbox\r\n   and the author of the message.\r\n*/\r\n.N2mZ7b col.Em3Oie { width: 4px !important }\r\n.N2mZ7b td.mka4te \u003e * { display: none !important}\r\n\r\n\r\n/*\r\n   Method 2: remove the whole column.\r\n*/\r\n/*\r\n.N2mZ7b col.Em3Oie { display: none !important }\r\n.N2mZ7b td.mka4te { display: none !important }\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n/* Remove the 'starred' line in the menu */\r\n.ybaOyc \u003e div \u003e div:first-child + div { display: none !important}\r\n\r\n\r\n/* Remove the star at the top when reading the whole message */\r\n.lHQn1d { display: none !important }\r\n\r\n\r\n/*\r\n   Remove the 'starred' and 'unstarred' selectors (above and below\r\n   the list of messages.
