{"id":3055,"name":"Gmail (old version) - navigation box (width mod)","description":"This style modifies the width of the Gmail navigation box (the area that contains \"Inbox,\" \"Starred,\" etc.).  The default value seems unnecessarily wide, so the (non-auto) values set in this style reduce the width to the minimum value possible in order to retain visibility of all the elements and maintain a balanced appearance.  Of course, these values can be changed to whatever you'd like.\r\n\r\nThis isn't necessary for wider monitors, but is of relevance for smaller monitors.  style 3056 compliments this style well.\r\n\r\n...I do have to admit that reducing the width of the navigation box does potentially reduce the visibility of contents of the labels box.","user":{"id":1340,"name":"USBman","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-07-31T01:25:36.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":619,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/3055-after.png?r=1676620818","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-07-31T00:12:23.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(mail.google.com) {\r\n\r\n\t.cn\t\t\t/* (blue background of) compose box */\r\n{\r\nposition:relative !important;\t/* this permits the entire email box to be moved */\r\nright:45px !important;\t\t/* this moves the entire email box value = 149px (original #nav width) - modified #nav width (below) */\r\nwidth:103% !important;\t\t/* this value is to correct for moving the entire email box */\r\n}\r\n\t#nav\t\t\t/* navigation box - this width defines the width of the box containing the navigation options, i.e., \"Inbox,\" \"Starred,\" etc. */\r\n{width:104px !important;}\r\n\t#co\t\t\t/* email listing box - this value should match the #nav width in order to keep the listing of emails properly lined up */\r\n{margin-left:104px !important;}\r\n\t.ma,\t\t\t/* bar above an attachment */\r\n\t.msg,\t\t\t/* message body */\r\n\t#ta_0,\t\t\t/* reply box */\r\n\t#ta_2\t\t\t/* reply box (before clicked on) */\r\n{width:auto !important;}\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":9309,"name":"Failtard is failtarded.","rating":1,"created":"2009-05-17T16:21:18.000Z","author_name":"Primus","author_id":28}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/3055/gmail-old-version-navigation-box-width-mod.user.js","style_settings":[]}
