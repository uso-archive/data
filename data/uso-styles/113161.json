{"id":113161,"name":"Furaffinity Sidebar Space Remover","description":"This is a code meant to be used in conjoint with \u003ca href=http://boothale.net/scripts/facleanup.html\u003ethis code\u003c/a\u003e, it removes the space above the FurAffinity sidebar that is left for ads to be placed there. Sadly though AdBlockPlus may remove the ad it sometimes has trouble removing the space left behind. I had made the attempt to try and remove the space through AdBlock but was not successful. I have only ever tested this on Google Chrome, I'm not sure what effect it will have on other browsers.","user":{"id":290496,"name":"Umbreeunix","email":"hgobill4@students.d125.org","paypal_email":"umbreecommissions@gmail.com","homepage":"http://umbreeunix.tumblr.com/","about":"Not really much of a coder, but I'm working on getting better so whatever codes I end up making will be posted here.\r\n\r\nAlso nobody needs to send me money through this site, I'm just putting my PayPal email here because... well I just wanted to fill out the info.
