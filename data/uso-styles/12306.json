{"id":12306,"name":"Wikipedia - Remove Notices","description":"Wikipedia's recent donation drive is starting to annoy me, so if you feel the same way, this style will get rid of the banner at the top of the page that asks for money. It will also get rid of any other notices that appear in the same location, so similar annoyances shouldn't be a problem for the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: I made this style because I overlooked style 12049, which removes the donation banner specifically. This style differs in that it hides that whole section, so that future notices with different element titles won't be shown either (until a site redesign, at least).","user":{"id":11431,"name":"Marijuana","email":"harland3@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-11-21T22:46:40.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":918,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/12306_after.gif?r=1687161611","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-11-21T22:46:40.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"wikipedia","subcategory":"wikipedia","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(wikipedia.org), domain(wikibooks.org), domain(wikiversity.org), domain(wiktionary.org), domain(wikiquote.org), domain(wikisource.org), domain(wikimedia.org), domain(wikinews.org), domain(uncyclopedia.org){\r\n\r\n#centralNotice{display: none !important;}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":11179,"name":"Nice.","rating":3,"created":"2008-12-06T10:32:07.000Z","author_name":"ambiguity","author_id":5156},{"id":14756,"name":"Thanks,","rating":3,"created":"2009-11-14T09:44:59.000Z","author_name":"eroock","author_id":6588},{"id":15539,"name":"More people need this!","rating":3,"created":"2009-12-18T05:10:16.000Z","author_name":"X172","author_id":34827}],"discussionsCount":3,"commentsCount":3,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/12306/wikipedia-remove-notices.user.js","style_settings":[]}
