{"id":728,"name":"Google: no ads and new style","description":"This style removes some ads (sponsored links) on the Google results page and gives Google a new appearance.\r\nSeems to look good on the search page results. Tested with Firefox 2, not with Opera.\r\n\r\nYou can also try the style 1082 style, which is a fork of this one and of the style 640 one. You can also try the much more beautiful but less ad blocking style 1781.\r\n\r\nBellow the details:\r\n  - recolorization of links (link, active, visited and hover) to the colors of the Google logo,\r\n  - add an indent for the text below the URL of the result,\r\n  - relax the width of the results to optimize the use of the available vertical space (less scrolling),\r\n  - add a round border to each result with a blue background,\r\n  - add an hover effect that makes this background and its border respectively switch to yellow and red (Google logo colors again).\r\n\r\nChangelog (19/05/2010):\r\n  - fix the total result width to 100% after the big Google look-and-feel refresh (margin-right set to 0px)\r\n\r\nChangelog (25/08/2009):\r\n  - fix the total result width to 100% (broken after a small Google update)\r\n\r\nChangelog (23/12/2008):\r\n  - apply (lately, sorry â€¦) the fix proposed by user 13778 (thanks to him)\r\n  - globally change all 'div.g' in '.g' selectors to be more change proof (Google has improved their page with a \u003col\u003e \u003cli\u003e structure)\r\n  - add another correction to prevent unnecessary line-break (disable max-width of the class 's')\r\n  - remove the 2px border on :hover to avoid the little sliding effect\r\n\r\nChangelog (27/03/07):\r\n  - add compatibility with Google preview extension for Firefox\r\n  - compact style for the \u003ca\u003e tag\r\n\r\nChangelog (26/03/07):\r\n  - apply some of the corrections made by user 823 in his style 1082 style both on CSS and domain where applied\r\n  - add some domains added in style 1082\r\n  - refactoring of add blocking to be more specific\r\n  - restrict the use of this script to only Google search results page","user":{"id":558,"name":"PomCompot","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2010-05-19T07:44:06.000Z","weekly_install_count":2,"total_install_count":10954,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/728_after.png?r=1687507280","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-07-31T08:21:14.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http://www.google.com/search), \r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.com.tw/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.co.uk/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.com.au/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.ca/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.de/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.fr/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.it/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.es/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.ie/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.co.in/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.ru/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.co.th/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.co.nz/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.co.il/search),\r\nurl-prefix(http://www.google.co.jp/search) {\r\n  .g {\r\n    border: solid 1px #3366CC ! important;\r\n    -moz-border-radius: 10px ! important;\r\n    padding: 10px ! important;\r\n    background-color: #E5ECF9 ! important;\r\n  }\r\n  .g:hover {\r\n    border: solid 1px #AB1501 ! important;\r\n    background-color: #FFF4C2 ! important;\r\n  } \r\n  a {\r\n    text-decoration: none ! important;\r\n  }\r\n  a:link {\r\n    color: #006699 ! important;\r\n  }\r\n  a:visited, a:active {\r\n    color: #008000 ! important;\r\n    text-decoration: underline ! important;\r\n  }\r\n  a:hover {\r\n    color: #AB1501 ! important;\r\n    text-decoration: underline ! important;\r\n  }\r\n  #cnt, .s {\r\n    max-width: 100% ! important;\r\n  }\r\n  #center_col {\r\n    margin-right: 0px ! important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n/* For Google preview extension compatibility */\r\n  .g {\r\n    overflow: auto ! important;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n/* Ad blocking part */\r\n  div[id^=\"tpa\"] {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n  }\r\n  table#mbEnd {\r\n    display: none ! important;\r\n  }\r\n  td.j {\r\n    width: 100% ! important;\r\n    padding-left: 1em ! important;\r\n  }\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":4857,"name":"this style prevents gmail's webchat windows from p","rating":3,"created":"2007-01-20T07:31:34.000Z","author_name":"Linchpin","author_id":1616},{"id":5218,"name":"Very beautiful","rating":3,"created":"2007-04-21T16:24:49.000Z","author_name":"Grand Koala","author_id":2501},{"id":10011,"name":"Doesn't work anymore, can you fix it?","rating":1,"created":"2008-08-20T22:50:33.000Z","author_name":"Soul745","author_id":6024},{"id":10013,"name":"EDIT: Hey, I got it to work!
