(Which is very nice if you use Classic Theme Restorer to bring back the Add-ons toolbar so you have a place for infrequently-used addons which can be easily toggled with Ctrl+/ )\r\n\r\nIt goes nicely with style 58450.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n#inspectThisPage, #inspectThisFrame {\r\n  display: none !important;\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
