{"id":120509,"name":"Laptop Drive","description":"Simple style, that removes a lot of the clutter from the sidebar in Google Drive.\r\n\r\nI often use laptops with very short screens, so when I try to drag files to the trash and the folder structure opens, the trash can scrolls behind the usage stats and I can't drop it in. This fixes that problem by removing all of the features I don't use from the Drive sidebar. Feel free to download and edit any of the buttons back in if you want them. Just comment out the appropriate line(s).","user":{"id":302241,"name":"endreman0","email":"ian.uu12@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://endreman0.github.io","about":"Moderate internet user and Firefox fanatic, but \u003ci\u003eterrible\u003c/i\u003e web designer.
