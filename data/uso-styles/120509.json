This fixes that problem by removing all of the features I don't use from the Drive sidebar. Feel free to download and edit any of the buttons back in if you want them. Just comment out the appropriate line(s).","user":{"id":302241,"name":"endreman0","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://endreman0.github.io","about":"Moderate internet user and Firefox fanatic, but <i>terrible</i> web designer.
