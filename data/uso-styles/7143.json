That is, don't try to install the CSS included below as it is only a placeholder!\r\n\r\nIf you like the style, please donate and help me pay my university debt. :)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n  *  I haven't tested the style to include any layouts of gmail except those that I use. In that sense this style is hard-coded. However, feel free to email me at  x o d d e r a   a t   g m a i l . c o m  if you want me to make it more flexible. \r\n  *  There are some bits I'd like to change, I'll probably get to those when I get the time.","user":{"id":8799,"name":"LukeM","email":"xoddera@gmail.com","paypal_email":"xoddera@gmail.com","homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-05-10T22:57:58.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1986,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/7143_after.png?r=1687334414","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-05-10T22:57:58.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n * =================================================================================\r\n *   Title: Mac OS Style - Redone (Modified)\r\n *   Author: LukeM\r\n *   Original Authors: \r\n *     Gmail.app (Mac Os Style) by leanDrow\r\n *     Gmail.app (Mac Os Style) - redone by Kemuel\r\n *     Some pieces of code (such as labels and attachment icons) from Gmail Redesigned by Globex Designs\r\n * =================================================================================\r\n */\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"mail.google.com\")  {\r\n\r\n\tbody\r\n\t{ }\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/7143/gmail-app-mac-os-style-redone-modified.user.js","style_settings":[]}
