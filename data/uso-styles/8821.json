{"id":8821,"name":"Transparent Tooltips - Global - Firefox 3 (WOW)","description":"Gives you Transparency on all Tooltips (Global style).\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8555 for this style to work!! **\r\n\r\n* Thanks to for introducing me into the realm of Transparency with style 4120\r\n\r\nYou can Customize the amount of transparency by editing the Opacity in the code (Closer to 0 is closer to invisible, whereas closer to 1 is closer to fully-visible - EXAMPLE: 0.5 is in the middle of opacity)\r\n\r\nThis makes your tooltips look really cool.\r\nThis style supports only Firefox3, giving it even more of a WOW effect!.\r\n\r\nApplies to:\r\n+ Navigation Toolbar (Hover over button)\r\n+ Hovering on a tab (tooltip will have radius)\r\n+ Also Applies to EVERY single item on any web page (Hover over a link)\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes! Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has rounded perfectly on each.\r\nFeel free to customize the transparency level (described above) ... no reposting mods though!\r\n* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8555 for this style to work!! **\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n+ Works only on Firefox3\r\n\r\nIntegrates with the following Styles:\r\n+ Style 8555\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8555 for this style to work!! **\r\n+ Style 8818\r\n+ Style 8558\r\n\r\nWorks well with:\r\n+ All of the Glasser / Transparent styles\r\n+ The Styles Displayed above\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.1\r\n+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"benbenben3@msn.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-11-27T14:50:17.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":4869,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/8821_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-07-15T17:49:42.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                    |\r\n|          Title:  |  Transparent Tooltips - Global                     |\r\n|    Description:  |  Transparency on all tooltips WOW                  |\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                           |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  July 15, 2008                                     |\r\n|   Last Updated:  |  November 27, 2008                                 |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.1                                           |\r\n|__________________|____________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n#btTooltip,\r\n#un-toolbar-tooltip,\r\n#tooltip,\r\n.tooltip,\r\n#aHTMLTooltip,\r\n#urlTooltip,\r\ntooltip\r\n{\r\n  opacity: 0.7 !important;\r\n  -moz-appearance: none !important;\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":6564,"name":"nice","rating":3,"created":"2009-05-09T16:20:07.000Z","author_name":"owen","author_id":13591}],"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
