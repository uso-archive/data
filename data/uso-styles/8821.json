Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has rounded perfectly on each.\r\nFeel free to customize the transparency level (described above) ... no reposting mods though!\r\n* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8555 for this style to work!! **\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n+ Works only on Firefox3\r\n\r\nIntegrates with the following Styles:\r\n+ Style 8555\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8555 for this style to work!! **\r\n+ Style 8818\r\n+ Style 8558\r\n\r\nWorks well with:\r\n+ All of the Glasser / Transparent styles\r\n+ The Styles Displayed above\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.1\r\n+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2008-11-27T14:50:17.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":4868,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/8821_after.png?r=1580284869","url":"/styles/8821/transparent-tooltips-global-firefox-3-wow","discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1,"css":"/*\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                    |\r\n|          Title:  |  Transparent Tooltips - Global                     |\r\n|    Description:  |  Transparency on all tooltips WOW                  |\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                           |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  July 15, 2008                                     |\r\n|   Last Updated:  |  November 27, 2008                                 |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.1                                           |\r\n|__________________|____________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n#btTooltip,\r\n#un-toolbar-tooltip,\r\n#tooltip,\r\n.tooltip,\r\n#aHTMLTooltip,\r\n#urlTooltip,\r\ntooltip\r\n{\r\n  opacity: 0.7 !important;\r\n  -moz-appearance: none !important;\r\n}"}
