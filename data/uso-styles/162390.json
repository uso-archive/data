{"id":162390,"name":"Wikia No Sticky Header","description":"Small stylesheet that unstickies the header bar on Wikia. Does not remove it entirely, because it contains useful links and tools, but does stick it to the top of the page instead of the viewport.\r\n\r\nYou may also wish to check out style 137367, style 137612, and style 137613, which I've tried to keep compatible. Combine them to make Wikia look how you want!","user":{"id":386476,"name":"Decanter","email":"fluid.decanter@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"arr"},"updated":"2019-01-26T00:11:50.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":283,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/162390_after.jpeg?r=1686988811","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"publicdomain","created":"2018-07-11T02:00:26.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"wikia","subcategory":"wikia","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain('fandom.com'), domain('wikia.com') {\r\n\t#globalNavigation {\r\n\t\tposition: absolute!important;\r\n\t}\r\n \t\r\n\t.banner-notifications-wrapper {\r\n\t\tdisplay: none!important;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/162390/wikia-no-sticky-header.user.js","style_settings":[]}
