{"id":8635,"name":"Animated Loading Spinner for Firefox 3 - Loading","description":"Displays a Spinning Animated Firefox Logo (Spinfox) when loading a page in Firefox 3 (About:Blank)\r\n\r\nBoth the Loading New Tab AND the About:blank's background image will be animated.  When you open a new tab, it will display this animated image until something from that site is able to be displayed.  \r\n\r\n* Loosely based on user 1744's style 1761 , and My style 6488 code... Thanks!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n+ Appears when opening new tabs\r\n+ Appears when loading new tabs content\r\n+ Appears within loading page contents (a loading div control containing a frame of another site)\r\n+ Appears when a page transitions to external or new domain\r\n+ Works in Firefox 3!\r\n+ Clean and very appropriate animated default image, included with style (Firefox logo Spinning)\r\n+ Makes your browser look great, and adds that \"wow\" factor.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n*NOTE: Please Clear your Cache and Restart your browser after installing or changing this style, your custom image will need to be cached in order for it to be displayed.\r\n\r\n* You may have to disable the following two styles for this to work:\r\n- Custom About:Blank logo\r\n- Custom New Tab Loading Image\r\n\r\nSimilar Styles:\r\nFor a similar userstyle, check out Style 8874\r\n\r\nAbout:Spinner:\r\n- The reason I do not use an Encoder is because I already tried to use an encoder, and it MAXES out the Max-Character size for Userstyles.org.\r\n- The only solution would be to locally link it to your own hard drive....\r\n- I can encode it properly locally, but cannot share the encoded style on userstyles without it kicking me out!\r\n- Any further suggestions are appreciated\r\n+ This style does still work great\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n- Initial Release","user":{"id":7858,"name":"dotter","email":"benbenben3@msn.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-07-07T13:49:29.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":19109,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/8635_after.gif?r=1680681614","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-07-07T13:49:29.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\r\n|                  |                                                        |\r\n|          Title:  |  Firefox 3 - Loading Firefox Animated Spinner          |\r\n|    Description:  |  Animated Firefox Logo will appear during pageloads    |\r\n|         Author:  |  -=Ben=-                                               |\r\n|   Date Created:  |  July 7, 2008                                          |\r\n|   Last Updated:  |  July 7, 2008                                          |\r\n|        Version:  |  1.0.0.0                                               |\r\n|__________________|________________________________________________________|\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\ntabbrowser tabpanels\r\n{\r\n  /* Change the URL Reference below to point to your custom image.
