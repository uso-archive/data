Disable notifications easily through the browser address bar.","user":{"id":531227,"name":"dizpastro","email":"mtyljensen@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2017-10-18T09:35:25.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":163,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/149793_after.png?r=1684137614","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":["https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/149793_additional_28295.png?r=1684137614"],"license":"ccbync","created":"2017-10-18T09:35:25.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"whatsapp","subcategory":"whatsapp","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document domain(web.whatsapp.com) {\r\n  ._3YewW {\r\n    min-height: 0px;\r\n    transition: min-height 0.5s;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ._3YewW:hover {\r\n    min-height: 48px;\r\n    transition: min-height 0.5s;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ._3YewW * {\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    opacity: 0;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ._3YewW:hover * {\r\n    position: relative;\r\n    opacity: 1;\r\n    transition: opacity 0.5s;\r\n  }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/149793/hide-minimize-whatsapp-notification-banner.user.js","style_settings":[]}
