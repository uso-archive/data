{"id":6525,"name":"Google Calendar Restyle [slimming]","description":"I use Google calendar in Prism [http://wiki.mozilla.org/Prism]. This is great, but I got annoyed at how much space all of the stuff I didn't need took up.\r\n\r\nIf you install Stylish in Prism you can use this there. It will work fine in Firefox as well, but I removed all of the links, search, etc. Everything but the calendar and the useful stuff.\r\n\r\nWith customization I'm sure you can decide what level you would like to slim it down to.\r\n\r\nI will probably update it often as I think of more things and have time. Feel free to send requests to my email [see the picture, it's displayed fairly clearly. If you can't make it out right click and 'View Image']. Or the forum, or your review, etc.\r\n\r\nChanges I make:\r\n\r\n-Remove logo.\r\n-Completely get rid of the header. Search isn't needed for everyday use.\r\n-Fix the margin.\r\n-Remove the 'Print' link\r\n-Remove the top bar\r\n-Fix the font \r\n    -Uses Droid Sans, my favorite font, by default. Then Verdana, then Sans Serif. Feel free to override or suggest better alts.\r\n\r\nAlso check out style 6411, my other style.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The black border around the second image is because it is a screenshot of Calendar running in Prism, so it has my theme. The first is in FF2 because it had the same rendering. The theme is Correcamins Theme 1 [http://art.gnome.org/themes/metacity/1357] if you like it. It is for Gnome (I use Linux).","user":{"id":7743,"name":"Dman","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-04-18T17:21:33.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":4583,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/6525_after.png?r=1678435214","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-04-18T17:21:33.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"google","subcategory":"google","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(google.com) {\r\n\r\n/*Restyle Google Calendar to fit my tastes*/\r\n\r\n/*Remove logo.*/\r\n#mainlogo {\r\ndisplay:none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*Competely get rid of the header.
