This version will probably only work with Firefox, sorry.","user":{"id":92489,"name":"riddler","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2013-07-15T15:49:21.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":3693,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/90514_after.png?r=1588752331","url":"/styles/90514/facebook-navbar-fixed-firefox","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"facebook.com\") {\r\n\r\n\r\n#jewelContainer {\r\nfloat: left !important;\r\nposition: fixed;\r\nleft:-655px !important;  }\r\n\r\ndiv._585- {\r\nfloat: left !important;\r\nposition: relative;\r\nright:-160px !important;\r\nwidth: 550px !important;  }\r\n\r\n.jewelFlyout {\r\nposition: relative; right: -260px !important;\r\n\r\n  }\r\n.beeperNub {\r\nposition: relative; top: -500px !important; }\r\n\r\nhtml #pageLogo._5bfh a {\r\n    background-image: url(\"http://i.imgur.com/kUOw5Vt.png\") !important;\r\n    background-repeat: no-repeat !important;\r\n    background-size: auto auto !important;\r\n    background-position: -6px 5px !important;\r\n    height: 29px !important;\r\n    padding: 0px !important;\r\n    position: relative !important;\r\n    width: 104px !important;\r\n    z-index: 2 !important; }\r\n}"}
