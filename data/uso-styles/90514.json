{"id":90514,"name":"Facebook Navbar Fixed (FIREFOX)","description":"Since Facebook's sadism department has decided to flip our top navigation bar around and most people seem to hate it, I've tried my hand at flipping it back. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done. The only thing missing is the little nublet (arrow) that would normally appear underneath the icons. I think that's something we can live without. This version will probably only work with Firefox, sorry.","user":{"id":92489,"name":"riddler","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2013-07-15T15:49:21.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":3696,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/90514_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2013-07-14T01:44:00.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"facebook","subcategory":"facebook","additional_info":"Update #1: Changed Facebook's new logo back to the old logo to fill the space better.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"facebook.com\") {\r\n\r\n\r\n#jewelContainer {\r\nfloat: left !important;\r\nposition: fixed;\r\nleft:-655px !important;  }\r\n\r\ndiv._585- {\r\nfloat: left !important;\r\nposition: relative;\r\nright:-160px !important;\r\nwidth: 550px !important;  }\r\n\r\n.jewelFlyout {\r\nposition: relative; right: -260px !important;\r\n\r\n  }\r\n.beeperNub {\r\nposition: relative; top: -500px !important; }\r\n\r\nhtml #pageLogo._5bfh a {\r\n    background-image: url(\"http://i.imgur.com/kUOw5Vt.png\") !important;\r\n    background-repeat: no-repeat !important;\r\n    background-size: auto auto !important;\r\n    background-position: -6px 5px !important;\r\n    height: 29px !important;\r\n    padding: 0px !important;\r\n    position: relative !important;\r\n    width: 104px !important;\r\n    z-index: 2 !important; }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/90514/facebook-navbar-fixed-firefox.user.js","style_settings":[]}
