{"id":120855,"name":"FF reader mode: real black background","description":"Firefox has the new reader mode (about:reader) to facilitate reading of (almost) any article in a simple, pleasant, constant style. However, the width of the article view is remarkably thin for a single column. Meh... change. This styles allows to customize the width of the view but also to use a layout with more than a single column, making it more akin to a newspaper.\r\n\r\nThis style based on style 114669 by user 13655. It adds the feature to choose other colors for the dark background mode - where I prefer #000000 as a real dark black. This also works on Firefox for Android and is usable for AMOLED devices, where the #000000 black looks really nice and saves energy.\r\n\r\nNote that since September 2016 the width \u0026 column setting has been removed as Firefox 49 now has an integrated mechanism to change the width of the reader mode.","user":{"id":302864,"name":"rugk","email":"700e8ef1@opayq.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"ccby"},"updated":"2016-09-25T13:22:22.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":409,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/120855_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":"ccbysa","created":"2015-11-18T17:46:21.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":"\u003cb\u003eLicense:\u003c/b\u003e\r\nLicensed under \u003ca href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\"\u003eCC-BY-SA 4.0\u003c/a\u003e by \u003ca href=\"https://userstyles.org/users/13655\"\u003eMiV\u003c/a\u003e.\r\nEdited by \u003ca href=\"https://userstyles.org/users/302864\"\u003erugk\u003c/a\u003e.\r\n\r\nOriginal version: https://userstyles.org/styles/114669/firefox-reader-custom-width-multi-column\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eOn GitHub:\u003c/b\u003e https://gist.github.com/rugk/6dd70c50c35ee750cb88\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cb\u003eChangelog:\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e2016-09-25\u003c/i\u003e\r\n* removed static width as it breaks the width changing mechanism of Firefox 49 \r\n\r\n\u003ci\u003e2015-11-25\u003c/i\u003e\r\n* improved comments in css files\r\n* better config on userstyles.org","style_tags":[],"css":"/*\r\n    Link: https://userstyles.org/styles/120855/ff-reader-mode-real-dark-background-col-width\r\n\r\n    Licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) by [MiV](https://userstyles.org/users/13655).\r\n    Edited by [rugk](https://userstyles.org/users/302864).\r\n\r\n    Original version: https://userstyles.org/styles/114669/firefox-reader-custom-width-multi-column\r\n    Available on GitHub: https://gist.github.com/rugk/6dd70c50c35ee750cb88\r\n*/\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"about:reader\") {\r\n\r\n  body.dark {\r\n    color:               /*[[darkcolor]]*/ !important;\r\n    background-color:    /*[[darkbgcolor]]*/ !important;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  .dark-button {\r\n    color:               /*[[darkcolor]]*/ !important;\r\n    background-color:    /*[[darkbgcolor]]*/ !important;\r\n  }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[{"id":448130,"style_id":120855,"install_key":"darkbgcolor","label":"Dark mode: color: ","ordinal":4,"setting_type":"color","style_setting_options":[{"id":1620254,"style_setting_id":448130,"label":"placeholder","value":"#000000","default":true,"ordinal":0,"install_key":"placeholder"}]},{"id":448131,"style_id":120855,"install_key":"darkcolor","label":"Dark mode: font color: ","ordinal":5,"setting_type":"color","style_setting_options":[{"id":1620255,"style_setting_id":448131,"label":"placeholder","value":"#F9F9F9","default":true,"ordinal":0,"install_key":"placeholder"}]}]}
