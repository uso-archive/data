Also... PLEASE DO NOT ASK ME TO MAKE AN HTML BUTTON. It's not within the ability of this site (which is for CSS edits/overrides only) nor is it within my skill set to make an effective button. If you really truly use HTML to a heavy extent, go to https://www.tumblr.com/settings/dashboard and change your default text editor. Beyond that, consider why and how you're using HTML so heavily in your posts on a site that does not call for it nor need it.\r\n2/2/15 - The fixed sorta didn't work on like any screen other than the main page. hopefully this works out a little better. Sorry it doesn't scroll with you if I can figure out how to magic that, I will.
