{"id":23269,"name":"Cleaner AITS - Spymaster","description":"Spymaster Advanced Intel and Tracking System (AITS) is a site created by Spymaster player @podcasting101 to collect gameplay \"intelligence\" on opponents, record game activity, and chat/socialize with other players. It's a great site if you love the game, but the chat widget is wonky and not very useful. Moreover it often crashes my browser. This style will remove the chat widget.","user":{"id":24942,"name":".LAG","email":"larrygreen@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-12-12T14:33:56.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":122,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/23269_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-12-12T14:33:56.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"spymasterzombie","subcategory":"spymasterzombie","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"stats.spymasterzombie.com\") {\r\n\r\n.art-BlockContent content { width: 100%; }\r\n.art-article embed { display: none; }\r\n#everywherechat { display: none; }\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/23269/cleaner-aits-spymaster.user.js","style_settings":[]}
