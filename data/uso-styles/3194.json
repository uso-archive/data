{"id":3194,"name":"Move Deviation Navigation","description":"So, dA has recently introduced some Next/Forward deviation navigation. Awesome many may say.

This simple style aims to move it somewhere that I think is a little more logical.","user":{"id":2125,"name":"sine-out","email":"lupperton@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2007-08-18T14:16:17.000Z","weekly_install_count":1,"total_install_count":510,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/3194_after.png?r=1687161674","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-08-18T14:16:17.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"deviantart","subcategory":"deviantart","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"deviantart.com\") {\r\n#table-deviation-nav{\r\nposition: absolute;\r\ntop: 28px;\r\nright: -10px;\r\nbackground: transparent;\r\ntext-align: right !important;\r\ndisplay: block !important;\r\n}\r\n#table-deviation-nav .deviation-nav{background: transparent;}\r\n#table-deviation-nav .tl,\r\n#table-deviation-nav .tr,\r\n#table-deviation-nav .bl,\r\n#table-deviation-nav .br{display: none;}\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/3194/move-deviation-navigation.user.js","style_settings":[]}
