{"id":1464,"name":"Zap2It TV Listings","description":"Removes all advertising (no ad blocking extension required) and horizontally expands the table for full horizontal resolution. \r\n\r\nI'm not supporting this style any more because style 1788 looks so much better.  If someone wants to take over development you have my blessing.  The screenshots are old.\r\n\r\nThere is an edit included if you want to remove the preferences box at the top, but removing this will remove access to a lot of personal settings.\r\n\r\n29 September 2006 - Removed the right frame ad.\r\n02 March 2008 - A little fix.  But remember, I am no longer providing support for this style and I am not spending a lot ot time in development.\r\n08 April 2008 - Try style 6301 for an actively maintained style.","user":{"id":202,"name":"Webb","email":"webbpa@justice.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2008-03-02T12:25:09.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1089,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/1464_after.gif?r=1687420815","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2006-12-01T05:59:23.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"zap2it","subcategory":"zap2it","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http://tvlistings.zap2it.com) {\r\n\r\n/* Un-comment this to remove the top bar */\r\n/*\r\n#zc-topbar{display:none !important;}\r\n*/\r\n\r\n#aff_wrapper,\r\n#zc-wrapper,\r\n#zc-wrapper-inner,\r\n#zc-topbar,\r\n#zc-topbar-features,\r\n#zc-shell,\r\n.zc-grid #zc-item table\r\n{width:100% !important;}\r\n\r\n.zc-program-detail\r\n{width:80% !important;}\r\n\r\n.zc-program-times\r\n{float:left !important;\r\n margin-left:10% !important;\r\n width:90% !important;}\r\n.zc-program-times div\r\n{width:15% !important;}\r\n\r\n.zc-station\r\n{width:5% !important;}\r\n\r\n.zc-episode-detail\r\n{width:50% !important;}\r\n\r\n#aff_header_inner,#aff_footer,\r\n#zc-topbar-leaderboard,#zc-footer,\r\n.zc-grid-ad,.zc-adspace,#zc-bar,iframe,\r\n#aff_rightbar\r\n{display:none !important;}\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":4672,"name":"Perfect!
