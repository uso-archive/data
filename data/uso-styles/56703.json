It is mainly useful within a sidebar such as Firefox's, which can be set as an option when you modify a previously created favorite (aka bookmark, hot-list item, etc).","user":{"id":87204,"name":"osirisgothra","email":"redacted","paypal_email":"osirisgothra@hotmail.com","homepage":"http://www.github.com/osirisgothra","about":"Gabriel Sharp\r\n\r\nI consider myself a lifetime student of Computer Sciences and Information Sciences, as the time for learning is never over, especially when working in a field that deals with envelopes that are ever-changing, pushing endlessly, so to speak. My work and play cross paths often since I get a lot of joy out of what I do and study, some of which are:\r\n\r\n- Perl + CPAN Developer\r\n- Linux C++ Developer (Qt4, Qt5, KDE4, KFM5, and related)\r\n- Shell Script Developer (Perl, BASH, sh, upstart, vim plugin development)\r\n- Web Style Developer (CSS, SaSS, SGML, HTML5, etc) though I do know HTML4 too [who doesn't?]\r\n- Windows C++ Developer (Old Pro in Microsoft related technologies)\r\n- Old-School Technologies (qbasic, vbdos, borland c++, ms-dos 6.66, i386 assembler /w emphasis on _some_ 64-bit stuff)\r\n- Music Hobbyist (Electronic Music Writer, Piano, Keyboard player/Enthusiast)\r\n- Graphic Artist (Pencil/Pen/Watercolor physical media, Maya/Blender/3DSMax/Bryce/Gimp/Photoshop HD and post-production)\r\n\r\nI am not currently in any group at the time. I am not sure if I will be doing that ever again. The last few groups I participated in were too incoherent and seemed to have different ideals, ethics, goals. \r\n\r\nI am open to suggestion or requests, just don't make them impossible for a single person to do. Requesting a theme have a black version is probably okay. Requesting that I personally show up and restyle your entire website is probably not. Of course, if I were getting paid to do it, that would be a whole other matter, but I rarely see people paying for such things these days when you can hire someone in another country to do it for 2 cents -- that's right I'm a bitter man :D= <- those are vampire teeth!!","license":"publicdomain"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2011-11-21T14:37:23.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":156,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/56703_after.png?r=1499256361","url":"/styles/56703/sidebar-friendly-sitepoint-css-reference","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/*\r\n   reference.sitepoint.com - sidebar friendly CSS for quick-reference usage\r\n\r\n   version 1.0 (preliminary release, please see below)\r\n\r\n   written by Gabriel Thomas Sharp\r\n   osirisgothra@hotmail.com\r\n\r\n   !important: PLEASE TURN OFF WORD-WRAP FOR BEST READING EXPERIENCE :!important\r\n\r\n   see all my other userstyles available for stylish on:\r\n\r\n      http://paradisim.zxq.net                                            (Paradisim L.L.C., Homepage)\r\n\r\n   or directly at:\r\n\r\n      http://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_terms=osirisgothra       (userstyles.org Homepage)\r\n\r\n   makes Sitepoint's css reference sidebar friendly making it nice\r\n   to use when writing user styles.
