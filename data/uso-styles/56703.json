My work and play cross paths often since I get a lot of joy out of what I do and study, some of which are:\r\n\r\n- Perl + CPAN Developer\r\n- Linux C++ Developer (Qt4, Qt5, KDE4, KFM5, and related)\r\n- Shell Script Developer (Perl, BASH, sh, upstart, vim plugin development)\r\n- Web Style Developer (CSS, SaSS, SGML, HTML5, etc) though I do know HTML4 too [who doesn't?]\r\n- Windows C++ Developer (Old Pro in Microsoft related technologies)\r\n- Old-School Technologies (qbasic, vbdos, borland c++, ms-dos 6.66, i386 assembler /w emphasis on _some_ 64-bit stuff)\r\n- Music Hobbyist (Electronic Music Writer, Piano, Keyboard player/Enthusiast)\r\n- Graphic Artist (Pencil/Pen/Watercolor physical media, Maya/Blender/3DSMax/Bryce/Gimp/Photoshop HD and post-production)\r\n\r\nI am not currently in any group at the time. I am not sure if I will be doing that ever again. The last few groups I participated in were too incoherent and seemed to have different ideals, ethics, goals. \r\n\r\nI am open to suggestion or requests, just don't make them impossible for a single person to do. Requesting a theme have a black version is probably okay. Requesting that I personally show up and restyle your entire website is probably not. Of course, if I were getting paid to do it, that would be a whole other matter, but I rarely see people paying for such things these days when you can hire someone in another country to do it for 2 cents -- that's right I'm a bitter man :D= \u003c- those are vampire teeth!!","license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2011-11-21T14:37:23.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":158,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/56703_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2011-11-21T14:37:23.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"sitepoint","subcategory":"sitepoint","additional_info":"Version 1.0 (preliminary release, please see below)\r\nWritten by Gabriel Thomas Sharp (mailto:osirisgothra@hotmail.com)\r\n\r\nRequirements For My Styles for Stylish: \r\n\r\n  * Stylish for Firefox or Google Chrome (can be hacked to use with K-meleon (tested) and might work with IE, Opera, Safari, etc when using it with/as a master style (see program's documentation for how to do that because I don't know exactly how.. and have not tested this).\r\n\r\n  * CSS3 is recommended, although CSS2/1 may work at least partially but is not recommended!!\r\n\r\n  * 1280x1024 desktop resolution is recommended, with the sidebar around 400px wide, other widths and heights may produce issues (see above about 'issues')\r\n\r\n  * AFAIK, a decent graphics adapter with acceleration should be used with CSS3 esp for composting effects, if this style uses them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  This is a preliminary release of this style, it has many issues but should work for a 400px width sidebar, good for 1280x1024 desktops-- if you have insight on any of these issues feel more than free to email me at osirisgothra@hotmail.com and I will give you credit wherever you have helped me out on the next release.
