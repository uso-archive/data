{"id":15872,"name":"Fix gimp.org site-nav with noscript","description":"Problem: If noscript in ff3 (tested on win and lin) is disallowing all javascript, the site navigation in container #menu becomes irrepsonsive.\r\n\r\nSolution Attempt: Since fading in the site navigation involves loads of javascript wizardry, the easiest solution I have found is to make the #menu un-floating which lets it become a new row between the title and the main content. I centered the link anchors inside instead of blocking them per line and added a .25em margin around the donation image. The splash area and intro paragraph are expanded to full width to fill the gap.","user":{"id":20949,"name":"tilt","email":null,"paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2009-03-12T19:36:05.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":104,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/auto_style_screenshots/15872-after.png?r=1677312015","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2009-03-12T19:36:05.000Z","category":"site","raw_subcategory":"gimp","subcategory":"gimp","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"gimp.org\") {\r\n   #menu {\r\n     margin: 0 !important;\r\n     padding: 0 !important;\r\n     float: none !important;\r\n     width: 100% !important;\r\n     text-align: center !important;\r\n   }\r\n   #menu \u003e a {\r\n      display: inline !important;\r\n      margin: 1px !important;\r\n   }\r\n   #menu \u003e a \u003e img {\r\n      margin: 0.25em !important;\r\n   }\r\n   #main \u003e div.splash {\r\n      right: 0px !important;\r\n   }\r\n  #main \u003e p.intropara {\r\n      right: 0px !important;\r\n   }\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/15872/fix-gimp-org-site-nav-with-noscript.user.js","style_settings":[]}
