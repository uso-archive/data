{"id":8213,"name":"AwesomeBar Results Sized Down","description":"I didn't like the minimalist styles for the AwesomeBar results that removed the title.\r\nSo I made my own that just turns the size of the text down and pushes everything a little closer.\r\n\r\nedit in response to Alaaddin:\r\nThis style was made on Vista...for Vista...and I have been using it since the first public Beta on Windows 7. Just installed it on a new reinstall (less than an hour old) of the release candidate and I am still happy with this style. I suggest you go with a different style or create your own if you do not like mine.\r\n\r\nThank you to those who actually did like the improvements I made.","user":{"id":11539,"name":"Thor79","email":"the.thunder.god@gmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":null,"about":null,"license":null},"updated":"2008-06-21T17:57:18.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":1278,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/8213_after.png?r=1673510498","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2008-06-21T17:45:36.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":null,"style_tags":[],"css":"@-moz-document url(\"chrome://browser/content/browser.xul\")\r\n{\r\n\r\n.autocomplete-richlistitem\r\n{\r\nheight: 26px !important;\r\noverflow: hidden !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.ac-title\r\n{\r\nmargin-top: -7px;\r\nfont-size: 85%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.ac-url\r\n{\r\nmargin-top:-16px;\r\nfont-size: 90%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}","discussions":[{"id":9082,"name":"Awesome....can't do without this for ff3!
