It compactifies the addon bar icons. This will disable some functionality on the items you put down there, so just re-enable them by adding their specific instance and defining the drop marker to be true.  I'll eventually comment in some code to make this easier.  I am using the Barlesque addon in the screen shots.  It is a good companion to this style but not required. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/barlesque/\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: This can potentially reduce the functionality of some of these buttons.  I am looking for a collection of buttons that can be commented in and out at the users will.  Just be aware that this can make some functions inaccessible via the add-on bar.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n/*This will hide a specific dropmarker for ad-block plus, and to give you an idea on how to do it*/\r\n/* #abp-toolbarbutton dropmarker { display: none !important } */\r\n/*This hides all of them in the adddon bar*/\r\n#addon-bar dropmarker { display: none !important }","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":null,"style_settings":[]}
