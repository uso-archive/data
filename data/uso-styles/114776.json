{"id":114776,"name":"Fx29 Bookmark Edit Star without *Show Bookmarks*","description":"Retain the Bookmark Star on toolbar that allows you to see if current url is bookmarked, and allows you to bookmark the current page, or to remove the bookmark from within Bookmark edit dialog.  This style removes/hides the Version 29 change which included \"Show Bookmarks\" menu attached to the Bookmark Star.\r\n\r\nSecondary feature of this style is to also remove the annoying animation when bookmarking via the star occurs, which was also added in Fx29 or later.\r\n\r\nThe tooltip indicates on the part being removed that it is equivalent to Ctrl+Shift+T, which is incorrect it is in fact equivalent to Alt+B (Windows) Bookmarks menu, from which you could invoke the more complete Show Bookmarks (Ctrl+Shift+T).","user":{"id":12592,"name":"David McRitchie","email":"dmcritchie@hotmail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://kb.mozillazine.org/User:Dmcritchie","about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"updated":"2015-06-05T15:23:02.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":332,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/114776_after.png?r=1681372816","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2015-06-05T15:13:21.000Z","category":"app","raw_subcategory":"browser","subcategory":"browser","additional_info":"You may have to restart Firefox for the style to be implemented.
