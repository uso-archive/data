This style removes/hides the Version 29 change which included \"Show Bookmarks\" menu attached to the Bookmark Star.\r\n\r\nSecondary feature of this style is to also remove the annoying animation when bookmarking via the star occurs, which was also added in Fx29 or later.\r\n\r\nThe tooltip indicates on the part being removed that it is equivalent to Ctrl+Shift+T, which is incorrect it is in fact equivalent to Alt+B (Windows) Bookmarks menu, from which you could invoke the more complete Show Bookmarks (Ctrl+Shift+T).","user":{"id":12592,"name":"David McRitchie","email":"redacted","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://kb.mozillazine.org/User:Dmcritchie","about":null,"license":"ccbyncsa"},"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"updated":"2015-06-05T15:23:02.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":325,"rating":null,"screenshot_url":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/114776_after.png?r=1577260874","url":"/styles/114776/fx29-bookmark-edit-star-without-show-bookmarks","discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"css":"/* Fx29 Bookmark Edit Star without *Show Bookmarks* */\r\n/* ================================================ */\r\n/* David McRitchie, style 114776, 2015-06-05  */\r\n/* see #fx29 in http://dmcritchie.mvps.org/firefox/firefox-problems.htm */\r\n/* Based on - http://superuser.com/questions/749303/firefox-29-keep-bookmark-this-page-hide-show-your-bookmarks-Button */\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n/* hide \"Show Bookmarks\" portion of Bookmark Star which is the Alt+B Menu on PC not Ctrl+Shift+B */\r\n#bookmarks-menu-button > .toolbarbutton-menubutton-dropmarker { display: none !important; }\r\n\r\n/* Remove animated annoyance when bookmarking page */\r\n#bookmarked-notification {animation: none !important;  }\r\n"}
