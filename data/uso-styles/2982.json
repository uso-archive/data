{"id":2982,"name":"SMF-Based Topics: Highlight First New Post","description":"This style adds a thick top and bottom border to the first new post in topics made in SMF (Simple Machines Forum)-based forums, in order to make it easier to see where the first new post has been made.  If the first new post is the first one on the page, its border will be dotted; otherwise, its border will be dashed.","user":{"id":2730,"name":"Wolfey","email":"73kbq4e02@sneakemail.com","paypal_email":null,"homepage":"http://wolfey.sillydog.org/","about":null,"license":"publicdomain"},"updated":"2011-07-24T22:10:31.000Z","weekly_install_count":0,"total_install_count":521,"rating":null,"after_screenshot_name":"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/2982_after.png?r=1685174415","obsoleting_style_id":null,"obsoleting_style_name":null,"obsolete":0,"admin_delete_reason_id":null,"obsoletion_message":null,"screenshots":null,"license":null,"created":"2007-07-23T15:17:55.000Z","category":"global","raw_subcategory":null,"subcategory":null,"additional_info":"[UPDATE: 2011/07/25]\r\n* Style will now work with the 2.x series of SMF (in addition to the 1.1.x series).\r\n* Updated the style's description to reflect the usage of different border styles (depending on the location of the first new post).\r\n* Moved release notes from the \"Description\" section to the \"More Info\" section.\r\n\r\n[UPDATE: 2007/08/07]\r\n* Topmost posts that are also the first new post in a topic are now highlighted; they are marked differently, using a dotted line (instead of a dashed line) and only modifying the top border of the post (instead of the top and bottom borders).\r\n* Posts in topics with polls are now highlighted.\r\n* CSS comments have been added for code clarity.\r\n\r\n[UPDATE: 2007/08/09]\r\n* CSS properties have been placed in alphabetical order.\r\n* \"Before\" and \"After\" screenshots have been added.","style_tags":[],"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/*\r\n   +---------+\r\n   | SMF 1.x |\r\n   +---------|\r\n*/\r\n\r\n/* New comment is elsewhere on the page */\r\n\r\na[name=\"new\"] + div + table + table + form \u003e table.bordercolor,\r\na[name=\"new\"] + div + table + table + table + form \u003e table.bordercolor,\r\na[name=\"new\"] + table {\r\n  border: dashed ! important;\r\n  border-width: 1ex 0 ! important;\r\n}\r\n \r\n/* New comment is at the top of the page */\r\n\r\na[name=\"new\"] + div + table + table + form \u003e table.bordercolor,\r\na[name=\"new\"] + div + table + table + table + form \u003e table.bordercolor {\r\n  border-style: dotted ! important;\r\n  border-width: 1ex 0 0 ! important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*\r\n   +---------+\r\n   | SMF 2.x |\r\n   +---------|\r\n*/\r\n\r\n/* New post is elsewhere on the page */\r\n\r\n#new + div[class^=\"windowbg\"] {\r\n  border: dashed ! important;\r\n  border-width: 1ex 0 ! important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* New post is at the top of the page */\r\n\r\n#new + .pagesection + #forumposts div[class^=\"windowbg\"]:first-child {\r\n  border: dashed ! important;\r\n  border-width: 1ex 0 ! important;\r\n}","discussions":[],"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0,"isPremium":false,"userjs_url":"/styles/userjs/2982/smf-based-topics-highlight-first-new-post.user.js","style_settings":[]}
