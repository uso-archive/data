### Description
Sick of seeing a header on FA you don't like? Think it's suggestive? Just plain awful? Well here's the problem to solve your bawfests.


Note: You can input your own custom made banners OR you can use one of the previous FA Banners: http://www.furaffinity.net/img/banners/logo/archive/

To change the banner look, put the URL of the picture you'd like here.. "background: url(PLACE YOUR URL HERE)"  and change the height to the image's settings.
Ex: If your image is 100x300px, change the height to 100px and the width to 300px.

NOTE2: To edit a script, go into Manage Styles > FurAffinity Header Blocker > CLICK EDIT > Enter Your Stuffs
