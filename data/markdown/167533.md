### Description
<strong>Hey! 👋🏽</strong>

This style is same thing as <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/164882/rainbowtube">RainbowTube++</a> but without the rainbow transition effect. Still comes with the same customizable settings and still works well with both <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/148466/flattube">Flattube</a> and <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/157126/cleantube-for-youtube-2018">CleanTube</a>.

TL;DR Just a minor alteration on the original 😁
