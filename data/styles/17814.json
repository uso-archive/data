    "description": "Find yourself getting distracted by having easy access to all the mail that you've archived so as not to let it distract you?\r\n\r\nThis CSS removes all links (a tags) to \"All Mail\"\r\n\r\n(If you need to get there in the future, click on \"Inbox\". Then, in the URL, replace \"inbox\" with \"all\" and hit enter. In other words, go to: http://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#all)\r\n\r\nThis is a handy site to understand the code: http://kimblim.dk/css-tests/selectors/",
