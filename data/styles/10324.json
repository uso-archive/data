{"id":10324,"info":{"name":"IMDB (set back to 100% width)","description":"www.imdb.com recently updated their website with a modified design putting the pages into a fixed width.\r\n\r\nThat's all very well, but i like viewing this particular website at 100% width.\r\n\r\nUse the following small style to get it back to 100% width.\r\n\r\nScreenshots not provided as it's such a small code, i'll include screenshots if i decide to start changing the rest of the look.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Removal of top ads etc... minor change...\r\n\r\nCode tested regarding trailer page, seems to work fine now.... The original trailer was larger then normal, i can see the IMDB have resized their trailers and the problem has gone as a result.","format":"uso","category":"imdb","updatedAt":"2008-11-15T02:59:50.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":14196,"name":"t31os"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1917,"weekly":3}},"screenshots":{"main":"10324-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":4,"commentsCount":4}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"imdb.com\") \r\n{div#root, table.outerbody, table#outerbody {width:100%!important;}\r\n[id*='swf_UK_Supertab'], iframe#top_ad {display:none!important;}\r\ncenter {width:0!important}\r\n#wrapper {background-image:none!important}\r\ndiv#main {width:auto!important;float:left!important}\r\ndiv#sidebar {width:auto!important;float:right!important}\r\ndiv#header {width:100%!important}\r\n}"}}
