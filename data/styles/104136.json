    "description": "Replaced by TV Guide (.co.uk) Minimisation MkIII (Jan 2015)\r\nTo permanently hide the side menu - which is intrusive, takes up space and I am always shutting it away!\r\n(This may be too drastic for some - which is why I have separated it from my other style for this site.)\r\nSite reloading does not need the \"now\" link - right click on the tab instead\r\nSelecting by \"genre\" I have never used\r\nI have it set to show 9 hours forward so never really need to select any time slot other than \"now\"\r\nChanging Channel selection - can use the pull down box at the end to just add a channel; if you want to do anything more substantial, just temporarily disable this style",
