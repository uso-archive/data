    "description": "Similar to other userstyles, this outlines rel=\"nofollow\"'d links, however this also outlines all immediate children of the links. This is for the case when the a tag wraps a block level element and the outline is not shown, for example:\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http://example.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">\r\n  &lt;h4>My header&lt;/h4>\r\n&lt;/a>",
    "additionalInfo": "In some cases you will get links that get double outlines around them. Due to the nature of css styles, there's no good way to get around that issue - but better to see the double outline than miss a link.\r\n\r\nThere is also a possibility of missing a link if someone has *two* wrapping inline tags around a block tag, but that seems like it would be rare.",
