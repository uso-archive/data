    "description": "As of 2013-10-09, Fanfiction.net seems to be abusing the user-select family of CSS rules to make selecting text within story chapters more difficult.\r\n\r\nAs this makes it more annoying for me to save quotes and causes problems for people using certain types of assistive technologies, Here's a userstyle to revert that change.\r\n\r\nI've included all known variants so it should have the desired effect in any browser with a userstyle harness.",
