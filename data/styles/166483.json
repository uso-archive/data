    "description": "helps resize webtoons images.\r\nmade because i wanted a larger image to view, sharing it because it seems to work as expected, and others might like it.",
    "additionalInfo": "this is very simple and uses % instead of px to define sizes.\r\nmax-width can be set to however much you want, this was made for a 1366 screen, so 1200 fit well\r\nremember to set both width and height to the same percentage amount, or the image will look weird\r\n\r\nhope you like it, and if not then feel free to tell me why.",
