{"id":53892,"info":{"name":"Facebook No Scroll Feed","description":"I'm a bit annoyed by the new scroll box on the right hand column of our Facebook home page. Since I have more than 1,000 friends, I noticed that it's a quite busy area, and I don't want it feeding and scrolling all the time. I prefer having a bit of control to read and scroll as I like, just using the main area of the site. So I just removed that new box completely. It's the simplest css script I have ever written in my whole life. Enjoy.","format":"uso","category":"facebook","updatedAt":"2011-09-21T12:01:16.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":57584,"name":"lu_","paypalEmail":"luiscarlosrubino@gmail.com"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":647,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"53892-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"facebook.com\") {\r\n\r\n#pagelet_rhc_ticker {\r\ndisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}}
