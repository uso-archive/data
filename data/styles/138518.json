    "description": "The CSS of the video player used for videos on Pearson websites (eCollege, MathXL, MyMathLab, etc.) has a simple mistake in the CSS. \r\n\r\nIf you've been trying to use captions, but they constantly hide behind the controls bar for a few seconds, then you know what I'm talking about.\r\n\r\nThis simple style simply fixes that annoying issue.",
    "additionalInfo": "The CSS of the video player used for videos on Pearson websites (eCollege, MathXL, MyMathLab) has a simple mistake in the CSS. The only time a transition delay is used is when the control bar hides, but that was probably left over by accident from an earlier version of the CSS. This ends up being a significant problem when closed captions are enabled, because once the seek bar enters \"mini mode\", the captions are hidden behind the control bar for 3 seconds. This style simply removes the delay, fixing the issue.",
