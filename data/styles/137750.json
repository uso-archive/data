Don't worry, serious sites are using HTML5 as a default anyway.\r\n\r\nThere is a myth going on, claiming you could legalize a ripped video through mirroring. Honestly?! Maybe they can fool youtube with it, but never an advocate.\r\nThis is the fix, but it can also be useful for studying of dancing steps.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to disable again after the video.",
