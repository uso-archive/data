This will make them think you are on a old-fashioned and boring-to-death and work-related website. You may need to change it to a custom one (grey, white...) to a more corporate one.\r\n\r\nAll images are by default in grey and black and almost transparent. Picture will appear with full opacity  but sill in B&W if your mouse is over them only. This feature reduce the capability of a prying eye to deduce anything in your disadvantage.\r\n \r\nThis feature is also to stop the usual suspicious behaviour (ALt+TAB) of the culprit which is a major hint that you were not working.","format":"uso","category":"global","updatedAt":"2016-11-25T17:22:22.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":287794,"name":"tafounast"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":217,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"135625_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http)  {\r\n    \r\n    /*all images (97% in real) are in grey& black to deceive eye prying detection pattern website pattern: blue->facebook, red->youtube... ;)\r\n    opacity reduce to the minimum so only you can see them\r\n    */\r\n    img {filter: grayscale(100%);opacity:0.1;}\r\n    \r\n    /*\r\n    Images appear briefly but still Black and white only the mouse is over the picture and\r\n    */\r\n    img:hover {opacity:1;}\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    /*uniform & boring background-> you are working ;)\r\n    */\r\n    * {\r\n    background-color: #D4D0C8 !important;\r\n    color: black !important;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    a:link {text-decoration: underline !important;}\r\n\r\n}"}}
