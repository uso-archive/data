This will make them think you are on a old-fashioned and boring-to-death and work-related website. You may need to change it to a custom one (grey, white...) to a more corporate one.\r\n\r\nAll images are by default in grey and black and almost transparent. Picture will appear with full opacity  but sill in B&W if your mouse is over them only. This feature reduce the capability of a prying eye to deduce anything in your disadvantage.\r\n \r\nThis feature is also to stop the usual suspicious behaviour (ALt+TAB) of the culprit which is a major hint that you were not working.",
