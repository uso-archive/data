Functionality was added to make these posts stand out and keep the Table of Contents human-readable.\r\n\r\nv1.2.0 - The Widening\r\nMade the site use most of the width available to it.  Doesn't look right unless used at 120% zoom, guesstimate values for regular zoom included in comments.\r\n\r\nv1.1.1 - Unquotening The Quotening\r\nFixed my screwup; can't mess with the top border of the quotes for some reason, so shrunk the bottom border.\r\n\r\nv1.1.0 - The Quotening\r\nI'm not really all that happy with this, but better a slightly broken looking quote than all that wasted space.\r\n\r\nv1.0.0 - Initial Commit\r\nThe initial version of the style.",
