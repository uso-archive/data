    "description": "This restores the blinking of the blink tag. Nobody uses it anymore, considering it died years ago, and wasn't ever supported by WebKit browsers, but just in case you come across it, here you go!\r\nThe blinking is visible 750ms, hidden 250ms, repeat. Rate is taken from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_element\">Wikipedia article</a>, which says that was the rate Firefox blinked.\r\n(Screenshot was taken from the <a href=\"https://porygonzrocks.github.io/blink-shim\"/>demo</a> I have on the <a href=\"https://github.com/PorygonZRocks/blink-shim\">Gihub repo</a>.)",
