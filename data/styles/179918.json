    "description": "The simplest one-line piece of CSS to combat another technology company that is trying to act like Big Brother. \r\n\r\nDo you want to cite evidence about environmental companies lying in order to push Global Warming narratives to gain government subsidies? Are you one of the few non-normies aware of the error in the original CO2 equation (by its very creator)? Do you want to be an insane person who sees the curvature of the Earth but still call it flat? And do you want to view any of this kind of content on Youtube, for fun or research, without being coddled like a child?\r\n\r\nRemove the \"clarify box\" below YT videos. One less piece of Big Brother.",
