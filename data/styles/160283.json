{"id":160283,"info":{"name":"New Gmail Trash Icon Spacing","description":"[Update: As of 6/5/2018, Google added a divider line between the trash icon and the 2 new icons.]\r\n\r\nThe new Gmail has several additional icons after the Trash icon (mark unread and snooze) when viewing an email.  I've added a larger margin between the Trash icon and the next icons to make it easier to navigate and matched to the old Gmail Trash location.","format":"uso","category":"google","updatedAt":"2018-05-21T18:58:58.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":653838,"name":"dwang99"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":48,"weekly":2}},"screenshots":{"main":"160283_after.jpeg","isMainArchived":true},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://mail.google.com\") {\r\n\r\n.G-Ni>.T-I:nth-child(3) {\r\n    margin-right: 24px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}}
