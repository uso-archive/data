    "description": "As of the latest 2.0a3 Nightly Branch Builds, you get arrows on either side of tabs, so multiple tabs can be \"scrolled.\"  Kinda cool.  However, I didnt' like the \"tiny transparent white\" markers - this is a \"dramatic color\" to show off the end button - but change to your liking.  I colorize active tab \"green\" and cut opacity on non-active; all I have to do now is make the arrow larger and I'll be set.  White arrow on black background would be cool . . . I'll work on it.",
