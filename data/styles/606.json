{"id":606,"info":{"name":"ScrollButtons Change Color","description":"As of the latest 2.0a3 Nightly Branch Builds, you get arrows on either side of tabs, so multiple tabs can be \"scrolled.\"  Kinda cool.  However, I didnt' like the \"tiny transparent white\" markers - this is a \"dramatic color\" to show off the end button - but change to your liking.  I colorize active tab \"green\" and cut opacity on non-active; all I have to do now is make the arrow larger and I'll be set.  White arrow on black background would be cool . . . I'll work on it.","format":"uso","category":"browser","updatedAt":"2006-07-06T16:40:55.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","paypalEmail":"paulbrit@gmail.com"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":597,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"606_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2}},"style":{"css":"/*Coded by Paulfox July 7th 2006 Ver 1.0 */\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n.scrollbutton-up, .scrollbutton-down {background-color: #FF66FF !important; }"}}
