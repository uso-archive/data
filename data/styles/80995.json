    "description": "If you have a Roku box, you can visit the channel store in a web  browser as well as through the Roku. Each channel has a 185px thumbnail with words below it. \r\n\r\nI found it too hard to tell the small blue \"Add Channel\" text from the small green \"Installed\" text when skimming the page to find channels I'd missed.\r\n\r\nThis style makes \"Add Channel\" into big yellow buttons that react when you press them. \r\n\r\nIf you already installed a channel, it doesn't get a big yellow button. Instead, \"installed\" takes on the appearance of a disabled control the same height as the \"add channel\" buttons.",
    "additionalInfo": "Initial release:\r\n\r\nThis release has only been tested on Firefox and Chrome for OSX, on a display maxed at 1280 x 800.\r\n\r\nOnce I was in there, I fixed a few other small things:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> Page was always slightly wider than the browser & had a horizontal scrollbar. I adjusted two different things, one to fix it for chrome and the other to fix it for firefox. </li>\r\n  <li> Proxima Nova is Roku's webfont of choice, but Light variant is easiest to read of them </li>\r\n  <li> \"Details\" links now vertically centered, and the installed/add channel links are right aligned.</li>\r\n  <li> The popup \"tooltip\" uses these same buttony controls and is now a little more opaque because I  couldn't read the words and stars well enough before.</li>\r\n</ul>",
