    "description": "When hovering over a \"special link\" (ie. a .EXE file), the Link Alert icon will be transparent, allowing you to see web content behind it.\r\n\r\nObviously, you must have the Firefox Add-on \"Link Alert\" installed (installer link below)\r\n\r\n* Thanks to user 6431 for introducing me into the realm of Transparency with style 6771\r\n\r\nYou can Customize the amount of transparency by editing the Opacity in the code (Closer to 0 is closer to invisible, whereas closer to 1 is closer to fully-visible - EXAMPLE: 0.5 is in the middle of opacity)  Currently, the code has it at .8 see-thru (which means it is 20% transparent and 80% opaque)\r\n\r\nThis makes your Link Alerts easier to see behind, allowing you to view all the web page content without moving your mouse, blocking the text or images!\r\n\r\nApplies to:\r\n+ Hovering over any content type of link (https brings up a lock, .js extension shows a javascript icon, new window shows a window...)\r\n+ Transparency on your mouse notification area for each link's file extension or certain Protocols\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.\r\n+ This style is FULLY customizable, and you can set the transparency to be almost invisible, almost opaque or anything in between!\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n+ Works on Firefox3\r\n+ Works on Firefox 2\r\n\r\nIntegrates with the following Styles:\r\n+ Style 8818\r\n\r\n** Must have the Link Alert Extension installed on Firefox ( http://linkalert.googlepages.com/ )\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.1\r\n+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.",
