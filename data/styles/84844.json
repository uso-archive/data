{"id":84844,"info":{"name":"Simple workflowy in bold monospace: light","description":"This style makes the text in workflowy bold and monospace. It also removes the horizontal scrollbar.\r\n\r\nWithin workflowy's settings, I personally use this with the \"Wood\" theme and \"Light\" font.\r\n\r\nWhy do I use \"Light\" font, not Wood's \"Typewriter\" font, which is also monospace?\r\n\r\nI like \"Typewriter\", but it isn't that visible on the iPhone, where I have no way to bold it. So I use the \"Light\" font on iPhone, but that switches the font on the web app too to \"Light\" too, which I don't want. So I created this theme because it gives you the option to have a different font selected on your iPhone or iPad than you see in your web app.","format":"uso","category":"workflowy","updatedAt":"2013-03-24T21:43:08.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":181597,"name":"Christoph Dollis","homepage":"http://ChristophDollis.com/"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":777,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"84844_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"/*\r\nSimple workflowy in bold monospace: light\r\n*/\r\n\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain('workflowy.com'), {\r\n\r\n\r\nbody, page-container {\r\nfont-weight: bold;\r\nfont-family: courier, courier new, monospace !important;\r\noverflow-y: scroll;\r\noverflow-x: hidden !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n}"}}
