    "description": "This style makes the text in workflowy bold and monospace. It also removes the horizontal scrollbar.\r\n\r\nWithin workflowy's settings, I personally use this with the \"Wood\" theme and \"Light\" font.\r\n\r\nWhy do I use \"Light\" font, not Wood's \"Typewriter\" font, which is also monospace?\r\n\r\nI like \"Typewriter\", but it isn't that visible on the iPhone, where I have no way to bold it. So I use the \"Light\" font on iPhone, but that switches the font on the web app too to \"Light\" too, which I don't want. So I created this theme because it gives you the option to have a different font selected on your iPhone or iPad than you see in your web app.",
    "additionalInfo": "If you do choose to use this theme, you may also want to check out my \"Monokai for Workflowy mod: dark\" theme http://userstyles.org/styles/84916/monokai-for-workflowy-mod-dark because you can install them both. Then you just leave the \"light\" theme enabled and you toggle between them by turning the \"dark\" theme on or off.\r\n\r\nSo you end up with day and night themes.",
