    "additionalInfo": "this is one of the first home buttons i've made so i'm happy with it but feel i could make a better looking image. i may make a new version of this later. for now though i think it's super cute!! i have other buttons and some themes that are also karneval related on my page if you're interested in any other styles ^-^\r\n\r\nUPDATE 11/17: i had a hosting issue but i've switched all my files over to photobucket and replaced the broken image link in this code, so it should work again :) if you have any questions or concerns you can shoot me a message <a href=\"http://boredartonline.tumblr.com/ask\">here</a>!!",
