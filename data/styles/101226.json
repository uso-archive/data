    "additionalInfo": "This script simply hides the recommended posts that tend to appear on the dashboard. Tumblr seems to be under construction almost 24/whenever, so if anything changes, it may cause for this script to stop working. If it comes to that, I will update it as soon as I notice.\r\n\r\nAlso I set it for the whole domain of tumblr.com, so there shouldn't be any problems with places it won't work, if you find something off, feel free to contact me or include/exclude it in the code as you please.\r\n\r\nGods I am pissed right now.\r\n\r\nGood day.\r\n\r\nupdate March 3rd2015 > also hides the new thing that throws blogs at you between regular posts, the hell tumblr??\r\nupdate May 30th 2016 > more stuff added\r\nupdate June 2nd 2017 > new line on sponsored posts\r\nupdate November 2017 > things. stuff.",
