    "description": "This background is a character from the show/anime Darling in the Franxx. Zero Two is one of the stars of the show and it is a very honorable anime.This was made for discord but you can use it for other purposes, it may not work for other purposes though. I did not make this image, in fact all I did was search up Zero Two on Google and found it.",
