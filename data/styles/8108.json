I'd recommend going about 250-300px less than your display's width to make room for the usernames on the left and the page borders.\r\n\r\nAlso take into account that sometimes jackasses quote the giant picture, and that box-within-a-box aspect uses a few pixels too.\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on style 2122","format":"uso","category":"clutchfans","updatedAt":"2008-06-19T02:13:15.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":11431,"name":"Marijuana"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":293,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"8108-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"clutchfans.net\") {\r\nimg { max-width: 750px;}\r\n}"}}
