    "additionalInfo": "Tumblr added another way to \"recommended\" blogs. So now it's an annoying \"Some more blogs:\" thing.\r\n\r\nIt even has a cute \"Please no\" button to remove it. But hey, Tumblr, guess what? Why don't you leave it away completely, how about that?\r\n\r\nMy mother taught me to say \"No thanks\", but I'm very tempted to say \"No fuck you\".\r\n\r\nDear Adblock Plus people: The rule is \"tumblr.com##.recommended-unit-container\" without quotes (generated by ABP Element Hiding Helper).",
