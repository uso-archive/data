    "description": "Wikipedia makes hella load of money - in October 2014, Wikimedia (owners of Wikipedia) announced to users that they had a $6 million surplus in funds. Just weeks later, they started posting fundraising banners again. I'm sick of these, I've stopped donating and now I've created this small code under cc-0 to hide Jimmy's banner. Think of it as a boycott.\r\n<br><strong><em>No futher support - released under CC0 - see profile</em></strong>",
    "additionalInfo": "<strong>Version 0.1</strong><br>\r\nI've blocked the current fundraiser banners, however the names change a lot. I've also blocked some past banners, in case they're used again. If you notice any new ones, tell me.",
