    "description": "I saw style 13056 and i really enjoyed it, but it expands player even when it should be normal size, so i made my own style, which works correctly in such situations.\r\n\r\nFor those of you, who haven't clicked the link to style 13056 and don't know what both styles do, i'll explain:\r\nIt resizes the YouTube player from default 854×505px to 1235×720px, which is much closer to 720p HD (1280×720px)\r\n\r\nImortant Notes:\r\n + I can`t guarantee full compatibility with any userstyle, which doing something with player margins, height and width.\r\n + Youtube expands player even if video is in 480p, it still looks nice, so you dont need to worry 'bout that ;)\r\n + This style works with new layout.\r\n + I`m not going to make big changes in updates, only small fixes.\r\n\r\nThanks for over 9000 of your installs :)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nApril 26th:\r\n + Fixed VEVO's video pages.",
