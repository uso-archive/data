    "description": "FIREFOX ONLY. Automatically switches IME between on and off state, based on which question type you encounter. So you no longer need to keep manually toggling between English and Japanese. Just make sure to keep your language and keyboard set to your Japanese IME when using this userstyle. ^^",
    "additionalInfo": "Firefox is the only major browser which currently supports the CSS3 \"ime-mode\" property needed for this userstyle to work. This userstyle sadly won't work in other browsers. I'm a Chrome user, so I dearly wish Chrome had this functionality. I now use Firefox whenever I do Duolingo just for this reason, as the Japanese courses are much nicer with this. ^^\r\n\r\nYou possibly may need to disable this userstyle when doing other courses on Duolingo. It shouldn't affect anything for most courses, but there's a good chance it might try to toggle some Korean and Chinese IME's on and off unwantedly.\r\n\r\nJapanese IME's remember their last output mode. If it doesn't seem like the userstyle is working, check that your output mode isn't set to half-width alphanumeric on Japanese typing questions.\r\n\r\nHope people like this userstyle. ^^",
