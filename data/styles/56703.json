    "description": "made for: reference.sitepoint.com\\css\r\n\r\nThis style is meant for stylish authors and for web-based CSS development applications such as web hosting applications that run inside your browser. It is mainly useful within a sidebar such as Firefox's, which can be set as an option when you modify a previously created favorite (aka bookmark, hot-list item, etc).",
    "additionalInfo": "Version 1.0 (preliminary release, please see below)\r\nWritten by Gabriel Thomas Sharp (mailto:osirisgothra@hotmail.com)\r\n\r\nRequirements For My Styles for Stylish: \r\n\r\n  * Stylish for Firefox or Google Chrome (can be hacked to use with K-meleon (tested) and might work with IE, Opera, Safari, etc when using it with/as a master style (see program's documentation for how to do that because I don't know exactly how.. and have not tested this).\r\n\r\n  * CSS3 is recommended, although CSS2/1 may work at least partially but is not recommended!!\r\n\r\n  * 1280x1024 desktop resolution is recommended, with the sidebar around 400px wide, other widths and heights may produce issues (see above about 'issues')\r\n\r\n  * AFAIK, a decent graphics adapter with acceleration should be used with CSS3 esp for composting effects, if this style uses them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  This is a preliminary release of this style, it has many issues but should work for a 400px width sidebar, good for 1280x1024 desktops-- if you have insight on any of these issues feel more than free to email me at osirisgothra@hotmail.com and I will give you credit wherever you have helped me out on the next release. If you are looking for general ad-blocking, there are already some good ad-blocking styles on userstyles.org, this is strictly meant for use as a sidebar app.  \r\n\r\n  Note that if you bookmark from the main css page, it wont display right because it wasn't meant to be used with this style. also, other parts of the sitepoint site are untested and are not supported by this style, so please don't complain about those unless you have some great idea on how to easily extend support to it!\r\n\r\nPlease see all my other userstyles available for stylish on:\r\n\r\n  http://paradisim.zxq.net  - Paradisim LLC\r\n\r\nor directly at:\r\n\r\n  http://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_terms=osirisgothra   - User Styles Index\r\n\r\nI recommend you bookmark on sidebar from this page:\r\n\r\n   http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/layout - Sitepoint Navpanel",
