{"id":21574,"info":{"name":"Adobes DevNet Reversed","description":"I didn't liked the layout of Adobe's DevNet with the articles on the right side and information about the article on the left. I always found it very hard to read because on longer articles there was a huge white space on the left side. I changed this and switched the columns and also changed the font-family to sans-serif and reduced the line-height slightly.","format":"uso","category":"adobe","updatedAt":"2009-10-06T12:09:00.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":6678,"name":"EarMaster","paypalEmail":"nico.wiedemann@gmx.de"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":148,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"21574_after.gif","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.adobe.com\") {\r\n  #article-C2 * {\r\n    line-height:1.5em!important;\r\n  }\r\n  #article-C2 {\r\n    float: none!important;\r\n    margin-left: 1em!important;\r\n    font-family:Calibri,Arial,sans-serif!important;\r\n  }\r\n  #article-C1 {\r\n    margin-right: 1em!important;\r\n    float: right!important;\r\n  }\r\n}"}}
