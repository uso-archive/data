    "description": "Cleans up Greasemonkey's toolbar button by hiding the actual icon and making the menu drop marker the new icon.\r\n\r\n1.0.5/2016-12-19 UPDATE: I've stopped using FXChrome ages ago in favor of Firefox Developer Edition and its theme and this little user style still could. Maybe it's time to drop the theme namedrop. ;) This latest update removes a lot of unnecessary seeming definitions but please do let me know if I broke it for you.",
    "additionalInfo": "Change log:\r\n\r\n1.0.5/2016-12-19\r\n\tRemoves a lot of unnecessary seeming definitions but please do let me know if I broke it for you. Also dropped the namedrop from the name.\r\n\r\n1.0.4/2011-12-08\r\n\tUpdated for FXChrome 9\r\n\r\n1.0.3/2011-12-02\r\n\tRealigned the icon because something changed in FXChrome or Greasemonkey. Didn't investigate further, just fixed it.\r\n\r\n1.0.2\r\n\tSomething minor\r\n\r\n1.0.1\r\n\tCleanup\r\n\r\n1.0.0\r\n\tInitial release\r\n\r\n\r\nBack story:\r\n\r\nWhen I moved the Stylish and Greasemonkey buttons to a more prominent place on the tab bar instead of hiding them on the menu bar behind an Alt press, I finally got fed up with the inconsistency of the look and feel of my tool button row. I was always right-clicking when I was supposed to left-click and vice versa, clicking the icon when it was the menu drop marker I wanted etc..\r\n\r\nToggling extensions fully off and on is rarely what I want to do. And when I do, the two clicks it takes me to do it from the drop down menu is fine, more appropriate even. That's how it works for Stylish and AdBlock Pro buttons. I tried to search for options and hacks for streamlining the Greasemonkey button similarly but since I couldn't find such within the first 30 seconds, I decided to make my own.",
