    "additionalInfo": "<b>Information</b>\r\nSo here's the problem; When the browser becomes too small to house everything in the footer, the two separate sections overlap one another. It so happens that the top footer is conveniently placed so it covers the input box for private messages, which is a real pain in the butt when you simply want to PM somebody.\r\n\r\n<b>GitHub release</b>\r\n<s>Instead of burying this fix in another style as an update, i figured I would release as something separate that people can use in their own work. Because there's so little to it, it makes no sense to republish this on GitHub. But feel free to credit <i>There is only XUL</i> / <i>tiox</i> or <i>@heebeejeebees</i> / <i>hebgbs</i> if you use it in your own work.</s>\r\n<a href=https://hebgbs.github.io/pmontop.css>I did it anyway.</a>",
