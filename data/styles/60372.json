    "description": "stuntkid, an artist whose work i admire, made a tumblr logo, and i, a rabid fangirl of his work, set off to find out how to put that logo in my tumblr dash for good. \r\ni did it, and now jason levesque's tumblr logo will be mine forever.\r\n\r\n{if any comments/suggestions, my tumblr is iliacrest.tumblr.com}",
    "additionalInfo": "http://thestuntkid.tumblr.com/ is the artist who did the graphics, i just swapped it into some coding i found here.\r\n\r\n\r\ni'm finally getting the hang of this coding stuff.\r\nenjoy!\r\n\r\n{screenshots are fuzzy because i accidentally deleted my copy of photoshop; will fix within a couple weeks, but it won't affect the quality of this substitute tumblr logo whatsoever}",
