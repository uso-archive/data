The style was mainly made for my personal computer and taste, and will probably not work very good on smaller screen resolutions than 1920x1080 and might look weird or not function properly with custom fonts and font sizes. However, it's not a very complicated style, so you could just hack it to your linking. Some ads might be shown, as I'm using AdBlock to hide ads and have not taken any steps to remove any ads.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the front page this is not intended - I'm still trying to understand how to make Stylish execute the style on every page, except the front page.","format":"uso","category":"wimp","updatedAt":"2014-01-29T18:58:19.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":255638,"name":"markussss"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":144,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"97675_after.jpeg","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"wimp.com\") {\r\n.post-to-wall, .sharetop, body > table:nth-of-type(1), body > table:nth-of-type(2), body > table:nth-of-type(3) > tbody > tr:nth-of-type(1), body > table:nth-of-type(4), br, td[width=\"15%\"], td[width=\"70%\"] tr:nth-of-type(2), td[width=\"70%\"] tr:nth-of-type(3) td:nth-of-type(2) {\r\n  \tdisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n* {\r\n  margin: 0 !important;\r\n  padding: 0 !important;\r\n  border: 0  !important;\r\n  width: 100% !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntd[width=\"70%\"] tr:nth-of-type(3) {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  top: -10px;\r\n  left: 0px;\r\n}\r\n\r\nembed {\r\n  margin-top: -10px !important;\r\n  height: 770px;\r\n}\r\n}"}}
