    "description": "Fixes the new Facebook chat \"bubbles\" that look like the old mobile app. Un-rounds the corners and gets rid of gradients and shadows.",
    "additionalInfo": "I know this may be cursing it, but it's almost been a year now with no updates to this script and it still works fine! Woohoo!\r\n\r\nNEW - Version 1.6 - Facebook has changed lots of element names and broken some parts of this. There's currently no way to change the background-color of chat boxes without also changing the colour of the timeline post time stamps.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.5 - Yet another fix for Facebook changing the names of divs. My life has become an eternal struggle of updating this every few days.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.4 - Brightens that horrible new dark grey background on the new Timeline by a bit. Personal touch. If you don't like it, just go into Stylish and remove the \"._5vb_, ._5vb_ #contentCol {\" section.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3 - Pretty sure Facebook is out to get me at this point, some additional div name changes and more !important tags.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.2 - Facebook broke something, I added !important to things now it works again!\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1 - Facebook removed \".bubbles\" div class, which broke the script. Fixed by removing on un-bubbler too.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 - un-bubbles chat, gets rid of box shadow and text shadow, gets rid of gradients.\r\n\r\nContact me @falolout for feedback!",
