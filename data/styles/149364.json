    "additionalInfo": "I removed this style for long because I suspected there was no alternative to the Stylish extension for Firefox and Chrome. The company which bought this extension inserted a malware collecting personal data. I did not wanted to contribute to this flaw by giving a new theme, then I emptied my contribution, until I found an alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extension was banned by Mozilla, but it seems to be back now. Maybe the company removed its malware from the extension, but I no longer trust Stylish and would recommend an other extension called Stylus. Your comments are welcome about this problem.",
