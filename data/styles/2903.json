{"id":2903,"info":{"name":"IBGG IconBuffet \"Spam Be Gone\"","description":"Don't you hate it when you get innundated with spam deliveries from those people clearly unable to read words of one syllable?!! Grrrr! Despite my profile clearly saying whether I have tokens or not, I regularly get unwanted deliveries from people despite my tokenless status, and they mount up, and mount up...\r\n\r\nI admit it. I hold stamps hostage. If people can't be bothered to read my profile, I can't be bothered to reject their deliveries, and feel no guilt at tying up their stamps. Some people just don't learn though, and send me not one, or two, or even three, but bucketfuls of icon sets, and they mount up, and mount up, and they're a huge PITA to scroll through multiple times every day. There must be a better way. There is. It's called CSS and thanks to the joys of userstyles.org and Stylish, you too can be spam free.\r\n\r\n\"Spam be gone\" simply does what it says on the tin, gets rid of those spam deliveries so you don't have to see them every day until they expire if keeping stamps hostage is your thing. Use it on it's own or with another style, and never again have to scroll through those spam deliveries, unless you want to!\r\n\r\nWant to see just how much spam you've got, or accept or reject a delivery? Just temporarily disable the style, then once you're done, enable again.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: No icons were harmed in the making of this style.\r\n\r\nNB: The screenshot shows the style used with the style 2904 style\r\nRead more about the styles (and better screenshots) and the IB Geek Girls on the IBGG blog: http://ibgeekgirls.blogspot.com\r\n\r\n\r\n","format":"uso","category":"www.iconbuffet","updatedAt":"2007-07-17T16:38:59.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":3039,"name":"NeonBlue"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":266,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"2903_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"/*\r\n * IBGG IconBuffet \"Spam Be Gone\"\r\n *\r\n * Author      : NeonBlue (aka FallenAngel) \r\n * Created     : July 17th, 2007\r\n * Version     : 1.0\r\n * Website     : http://ibgeekgirls.blogspot.com\r\n * Description : (includes all subdomains) hides deliveries list.\r\n *             : Just temporarily disable the style and reload page to accept or \r\n *             : decline deliveries\r\n * Usage       : Use with Stylish Firefox extension (http://userstyles.org/) or copy to your Firefox userContent.css file\r\n */\r\n\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http://www.iconbuffet), url-prefix(http://www.iconbuffet)\r\n{\r\n\r\n#messages { display: none; }\r\n\r\n}"}}
