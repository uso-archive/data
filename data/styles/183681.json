    "additionalInfo": "To apply the style, click on your profile name (top right corner) -> Board Theme -> CHOOSE THE PURPLE THEME\r\n\r\nThe images the CSS is using are not well-polished but I'm ok with them, they do their job and I don't feel like investing much time into making them perfect. If their imperfections bother you, PM me on lichess (@moskvitin) with your improvements suggestions.",
