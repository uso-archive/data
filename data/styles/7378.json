{"id":7378,"info":{"name":"hulu.com - lights OUT!","description":"Now when you choose to 'lower the lights', they're lowered right off - turning the area around the video completely black. \r\n\r\nNote that the gradient background around the videos has been turned solid black, whether the lights are on or off. This is because hulu.com doesn't change it, and hence I had no way to target it only when the lights where out. Personally, I didn't like the gradient anyhow, but I thought I should mention it.","format":"uso","category":"hulu","updatedAt":"2008-05-20T06:10:35.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":608,"name":"thespook","paypalEmail":"gotspook@gmail.com"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1454,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"7378-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.hulu.com\") {\r\n#overlay-top, #overlay-bottom{opacity:1!important}\r\n\r\n#description-container[style*=\"rgb(51, 51, 51)\"]{background:#000!important}\r\n#description-container[style*=\"rgb(51, 51, 51)\"] *{color:#000!important}\r\n#description-container[style*=\"rgb(51, 51, 51)\"] h2 span{color:#222!important;padding-left:60px!important;display:block}\r\n\r\n#breakout-container{background:#000!important}\r\n}"}}
