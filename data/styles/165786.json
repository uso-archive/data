    "description": "Tired of riding your mounts? Dismount them for awhile!",
    "additionalInfo": "The way the avatar is put together is kind of complex so I'm terrified of this breaking but it seems to work. If you see any mounts breaking the bounds of the avatar area (i.e. trying to go past the edge of a background), let me know. I tried to position the mount to give the greatest visibility of its front end that I could but it was a little difficult to do in a way that worked for as many mounts as possible.\r\n\r\nDismounts everyone, not just you. May fix that in a little bit, or offer a choice.\r\n\r\nUpdate notes 2022-08-10: Fixes an issue with mount disappearing if background is unequipped, as well as a floating avatar issue in the avatar modal.",
