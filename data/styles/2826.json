Or for them who have screens with very low resolution.\r\n\r\nMake the reservation pages of www.sj.se narrower by removing the left navigation box. You can still navigate by the top navigation bar.\r\n \r\nThe total width is reduced from ca 770px to ca 620px.\r\n\r\nUpdate: since some time, their web page is re-designed and this style is not needed any more (obsolete).",
