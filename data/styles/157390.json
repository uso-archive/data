    "description": "For Chrome Remote Desktop: The amount of padding Google has arbitrarily shoved on this list of desktops is nauseating. Even if you were on a touchscreen, you'd have to be a power-puff girl or a Muppet to require as much padding as Google has used here. This fixes that.",
    "additionalInfo": "v1.0.2, 3.21.2018 Release\r\n--------\r\nNow applies to variations of the URL (when using multiple users in Chrome, the address would change based on which user you were logged in with).\r\n\r\nv1.0.1, 3.21.2018 Release\r\n--------\r\nAdjusted more to help make it look nicer.\r\n\r\nv1.0.0, 3.20.2018 Release\r\n---------\r\nThis applies to the https://remotedesktop.google.com/access page (the one that lists all your desktops).",
