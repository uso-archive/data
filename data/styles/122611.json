    "description": "For people who don't like what Dubtrack provides for SoundCloud songs without images by default.",
    "additionalInfo": "<b>Information</b>\r\nThis style will replace the default SoundCloud images (yes, Dubtrack uses two of them, if you never previewed a SoundCloud-accessible song) with an image and background colour of your choosing.\r\n\r\nFor communities, this means that community themes can use a logo of some kind to go with their community, rather than the default Dubtrack logo, and have that occupy the entire player.\r\n\r\n<b>Use notes</b>\r\nBecause this style uses a single background declaration for layering images, you can layer all the images you want! Just remember that bottom of the list = bottom of the stack.\r\n\r\nYou can also make the bottom layer use a linear gradient instead with a top and bottom of equal height that is transparent if you wanted a quick and dirty banner solution. This means you can make the player look super-fancy without needing to screw with background colours. Example:\r\nlinear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 35%, black 35%, black 75%, transparent 75%, transparent 100%)\r\n\r\nThis is not limited to static images; Animations can be used, but they must be GIF, unless you're animating the entire image. Clever coders can probably find a way to use a pseudochild if they need to.\r\n\r\n<b>GitHub release</b>\r\nFor inclusion in your community theme, you can <a href=http://hebgbs.github.io/scimg.css>get it here.</a>",
