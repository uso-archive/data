{"id":8740,"info":{"name":"MySpace - Forum Cleaner","description":"Remove certain things from forums (Either on the MySpace forums, school forums, or group forums)\r\n\r\nFeel free to edit the code to suit your preferences. There's a list of things you can remove in the code.\r\n\r\nScreenshots on old page:\r\nstyle 5628\r\n(The before and after screenshots are just screenshots, not before and after screenshots! The first one is for groups/school forums, and the second one is for the regular MySpace forums.)\r\n\r\nEDIT: I added \"blockquote blockquote\" to the list which gets rid of blockquotes that're in blockquotes. This removes multiple quotes in posts. :) For anyone who's annoyed by pages that're looooong because the posters are too lazy to remove some damn quotes. (NOTE: This does not remove the quotes when you quote a post, it just hides them!)","format":"uso","category":"myspace","updatedAt":"2008-08-20T11:27:05.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":12244,"name":"Dakata"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":403,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"8740-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"/*\r\nUserstyle by Dakata\r\nhttp://userstyles.org/users/12244\r\nhttp://angstdragon.co.nr\r\n\r\nLast updated August 20th, '08\r\n*/\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"myspace.com\") {\r\n a.sendmsg, div.aboutuser, div.sidetwo, div.ForumSubTitle,  span.breadCrumb#ctl00_ctl00_cpMain_CommonTop_BreadCrumb1, select#ctl00_ctl00_cpMain_bcr_SorterTop_SorterTop, li.ForumPostUserAttribute, li.ForumPostListLinks, td.ForumPostFooterArea, select#ctl00_ctl00_cpMain_bcr_PostListSorter1_PostListSorter1, blockquote blockquote, div#footer {\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;} }"}}
