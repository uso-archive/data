    "additionalInfo": "<i>(pronounced kuh-spin, not cas-pin)</i>\r\nThis should work with all of the seasonal Kahoot! logo variations, especially if you have version 1.2.3 or above.\r\n\r\nThis is in the public domain, but credit is appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.2.3 — December 16th, 2019:\r\n- Made the logo spin again\r\n- Future-proofed the selector so it shouldn't break from site updates anymore\r\nNote: The style now only targets the URLs it's supposed to work on in order to prevent the future-proofing from breaking other pages. This shouldn't affect anything unless they change the URLs I targeted in the future.\r\n\r\n1.2.2 — November 19th, 2019:\r\n(That's cute. I released 1.2 exactly one year ago today.)\r\n- Restored Kahoot! v1 behavior (Kahoot! logo spins automatically again)\r\nNote: Bringing back the new behavior isn't a high priority right now. Sorrrry.\r\n\r\n<i>The following versions are very old and I do not have access to them anymore. I strongly recommend updating if you haven't already. With the release of 1.2.3, I am now archiving old versions of this style I have access to (1.2.2 and up) for historical purposes.</i>\r\n\r\n1.2.1 — September 23rd, 2019:\r\n- Fixed for Kahoot! v2\r\n- Fixed the animation length and loop settings\r\nNote: Unfortunately, due to Kahoot! v2, I can't make the logo spin unless the spinner appears first. I will be trying to fix this.\r\n\r\n1.2 — November 19th, 2018\r\n- Added support for the kahoot.it/join page (the page you go to after entering the Game PIN)\r\n\r\n1.1 — November 14th, 2018\r\n- Added animation speed and loop options\r\n\r\n1.0 — November 7th, 2018\r\n- Initial release",
