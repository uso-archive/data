    "additionalInfo": "Update 2023-02-15: This is the test for mirror sites to see if the license properly changes alongside an update to the style. This style's previous license was more permissive (and irrevocable) so this change is largely symbolic, but it is representative of a desire of mine that this style not be forked. This style is among a list that may soon be deleted.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2023-02-13: This was intended to be a test license shift to make sure a massive change I am bringing to my styles is handled correctly by mirrors, but it turns out USO no longer lets you change license in the upload form at all, so I guess this is now a latency test.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2018-10-02: Remove special inn spacing since the site seems to intelligently handle that on its own now.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2018-05-27: Restickied the navbar part of the header! (Slightly adjusted code from Riverstone in the Aspiring Tailors guild.)\r\n\r\nUpdate 2018-04-13: Adjusted for inn banner so this style doesn't cover up 40px of the page when the user is checked into the inn and hasn't dismissed the inn banner at the top of the screen.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI don't *think* there are any bugs but let me know if you find one!",
