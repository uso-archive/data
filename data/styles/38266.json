    "additionalInfo": "So, the ads you see in the video are inskin ads. They can be removed but the video\r\nwon't play if you do that. You can hide the ad and just have the audio playing, \r\nwhich isn't really much of an improvement. Not really worth the effort at the moment.\r\n#bnt_expandable is the ad div, maybe the key is around that.",
