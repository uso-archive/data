    "description": "I knew practically nothing about CSS before last month, then Zap2it pushed me over the edge by forcing me to see ABC's listings (which is not in my favorites) at the top of the grid - with an irritating background image included. Anyway, this style sheet gives a more usable 6-hour grid by increasing the width and removing the rest of the stuff that I don't use and don't want.\r\n\r\nSee the comments in the code for more information.\r\n\r\nAlso note, I've been using Firefox 1.5 until a few months ago (Dec. '08) and it correctly displayed the sizes of boxes in the grid. Then I upgraded to version 3.04 and the boxes for different stations vary in size, leading to them not line up properly with the grid times. I have yet to investigate to see if newer versions of Firefox fix this problem, but I have been using this style sheet in Opera (9.5 beta) instead as it works properly. (Update June '10: using Firefox 3.6 now and they're displayed properly again.)",

I'm not certain how (or if it's possible) to remove the mouseover ads for Fox. (If you know and could e-mail me at my username at gmail.com, then I would be happy to remove those ads. I just don't have the time to investigate something that's specific to one station and likely to be temporary.)\r\n\r\n2008-08-01: modified to fix recent changes to the grid.\r\n\r\n2008-04-14: grid is now displayed at the top of the browser page again.\r\n\r\n2008-04-12: removed the ads from the left hand side.",
