{"id":25091,"info":{"name":"LibraryThing - Touchstones Link Fix","description":"This is a very quick and crude fix so that when a \"Touchstone\" is clicked on, the old menu that used to appear will show. Word of warning, it'll show two links under the touchstone after you click it.  Highlight doesn't seem to work.  I might try to combine this styleshee tweak with a Greasemonkey script to provide a more useful set of choices. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPainful details:\r\n\r\nSo say you have the following touchstones in a list:\r\n\r\nMrs. Piggle-Wiggle by Betty MacDonald\r\nThe Elephant Man by Bernard Pomerance\r\nEast of Eden by John Steinbeck\r\nAnna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy\r\n\r\nClicking on \r\nMrs. Piggle-Wiggle by Betty MacDonald\r\n\r\nwill cause two links to appear below the title/author.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Piggle-Wiggle by Betty MacDonald\r\nhighlight | work info","format":"uso","category":"librarything","updatedAt":"2010-02-11T00:25:07.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":41456,"name":"jtgorman"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":183,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document domain(librarything.com) {\r\n  div.touchstones div.pick div.hidden {\r\n    visibility:visible !important;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n"}}
