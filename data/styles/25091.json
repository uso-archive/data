    "name": "LibraryThing - Touchstones Link Fix",
    "description": "This is a very quick and crude fix so that when a \"Touchstone\" is clicked on, the old menu that used to appear will show. Word of warning, it'll show two links under the touchstone after you click it.  Highlight doesn't seem to work.  I might try to combine this styleshee tweak with a Greasemonkey script to provide a more useful set of choices. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPainful details:\r\n\r\nSo say you have the following touchstones in a list:\r\n\r\nMrs. Piggle-Wiggle by Betty MacDonald\r\nThe Elephant Man by Bernard Pomerance\r\nEast of Eden by John Steinbeck\r\nAnna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy\r\n\r\nClicking on \r\nMrs. Piggle-Wiggle by Betty MacDonald\r\n\r\nwill cause two links to appear below the title/author.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Piggle-Wiggle by Betty MacDonald\r\nhighlight | work info",
