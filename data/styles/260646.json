We won't stop crying our eyes out eating ice cream while watching Miraculous, thinking about how beautiful it is. We will always love our dense Adrien, our kind Marinette, our strong ALya, our chill Nino, and every other Miraculous character that we cherish and bury deep within our hearts. Miraculous Fandom unite!",
