Also fixed the inline \"code\" element which had a white background and was unreadable.","format":"uso","category":"wikipedia","updatedAt":"2010-06-17T08:03:09.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":50239,"name":"cecilkorik"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":702,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"30211-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"wikipedia.org\") {\r\n\r\n\r\nbody { background-color: #050505 !important; }\r\n#head { background-color: #050505 !important; }\r\n#mw-head { background-color: #050505 !important; }\r\n#mw-panel { background-color: #050505 !important; }\r\ncode { background-color: #225 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs li a, div.vectorTabs li a span { color: #888 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs li.selected a, div.vectorTabs li.selected a span { color: #88f !important; background-color: #222 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs ul li { background-image: none !important; background-color: #111 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs li a { background-image: none !important; border-right: 1px solid #666 !important; }\r\ndiv.vectorTabs { background-image: none !important; border-left: 1px solid #666 !important; }\r\n\r\n}"}}
