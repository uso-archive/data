    "additionalInfo": "Rather annoying that Fanfiction.net disabled text selection, this makes it so that text can be selected again.\r\n\r\nWorks as of 10/10/2013. FF tends to change their site fairly often though. Also written for Firefox, no idea how to write it for Chrome since the docs on Github don't say what the website filtering code should be for Chrome.",
