    "description": "This VERY SIMPLE style hides spoiler elements from the Netflix GUI.\r\nElements hidden :\r\n - background picture displayed during the loading of the video (major source of spoiling)\r\n - background picture displayed between episodes\r\n - rotating pictures taken from the movie/show while hovering titles",
    "additionalInfo": "According to my tests after a few weeks, it doesn't break any Netflix features, all actions/buttons (video loading, clicks on movie/next episode, ...) are still working as intended, only spoiler pictures are hidden.\r\n\r\nObviously english isn't my native language, so if you have a better description, don't hesitate to send it to me. \r\nThis is public licence so feel free to use this very short code to create/improve other userstyles/browser extensions.",
