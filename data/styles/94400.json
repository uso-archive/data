{"id":94400,"info":{"name":"Remove external ads on Amazon","description":"This style removes Amazon's ads to external services. Those are the boxes that say \"Advertisement\" under them. As an Amazon Prime member who buys a great deal of things exclusively through Amazon, I got tired of seeing flashy ads on every page when all I wanted to do was find and buy something. This style does not remove ads for Amazon's own services, such as ads for items for sale or the Amazon credit card.","format":"uso","category":"amazon","updatedAt":"2013-10-23T10:45:11.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":235628,"name":"michaelday"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":920,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"94400-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"amazon.com\") {\r\n#navbar.nav-beacon #welcomeRowTable {\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#nav_sitewide_msg_4192_primary {\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nobject.adNoOutline {\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#leftNavAdvertising {\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#DAr2 {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n  \r\n#DAr7 {\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n  \r\niframe {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}}
