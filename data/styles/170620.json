    "description": "For those of us musicians that use a laptop on stage instead of a tablet for tabs/notes while playing worship music, you're going to want this. If your lights team needs to do a black out mode, it'll help prevent you from still being illuminated while on stage. Plus, it'll save your eyes.\r\n\r\nI hope it comes in handy! Blessings!",
    "additionalInfo": "Please use a modern browser. This style leverages the css attribute \"filter\" which is not supported on ie11. If you're using ie11, first of all please please please stop it. I value your safety and quality of life and ie11 won't help you achieve that anymore.\r\n\r\nChrome, Edge and FireFox are great browsers. Use those instead. Happy playing!",
