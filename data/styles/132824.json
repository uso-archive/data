    "description": "Have you ever wanted to visit Serebii to use the Pokédex, Pokéarth, etc. but you don't want Sun and Moon spoilers? This small script blurs out all news content, including images, video, and text. It does leave the header and titles for each news article unblurred so that you can see if the content is something you want to see. If you do want to view something, just hover over it. Sure, you could just avoid the Index, but then you won't see any non-Sun and Moon news either.\r\n\r\nDue to the way the site is coded, some images won't reveal themselves on hover. This would be very hard, if not impossible to fix with a simple userstyle.",
