{"id":127464,"info":{"name":"Fark - Remove ads disguised as headlines","description":"With the Fark layout changes in April 2016 my ad and script blockers stopped being able to block the adverts that are in amongst the headlines.

I created this purely for personal use with my specific plug-in and style configurations, so it might have unintended effects with your config, but figured I'd share. Use at your own risk, etc etc.","format":"uso","category":"fark","updatedAt":"2016-05-04T15:46:30.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":331136,"name":"p4riah"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":43,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"127464_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"fark.com\") {\r\n  .spau {display:none;}\r\n}"}}
