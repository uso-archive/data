    "description": "[May 30th, 2009]:\r\n\r\nComplete Overhaul\r\n.. row highlighting\r\n.. shortened email list\r\n... expanded msg list height\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you prefer the speed of the Classic view, then here's something to push the crappy classic view up a knotch. \r\n\r\n- Ads removed\r\n- Email listing line spacing increased\r\n- Row highlighting\r\n- \"Mark as Unread\" and \"Print\" button removed from listing view. (I never click these so I figured..)\r\n- \"Web\" button for search removed. \r\n- Message numbers and page numbers bar removed. There is another one on the bottom. You only need one..\r\n- a few other small things..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not a pro scripter so there are a few things I wanted to do but couldn't and well, I really just don't have time. Exams are coming up soon. \r\n\r\n - The status bar flashes like crazy with the links. It'd be nice if anyone could do a greasemonkey script and get rid of that.\r\n - The reply icons don't have transparent backgrounds. Not severe at all. But some people may find it annoying. \r\n \r\n\r\n[Edited]: Updated\r\n\r\n[April 24th, 2008]: Fixed a few things. The headers were missing and now the headers are highlighted a different color. \r\n\r\n[June 21st, 2008]: I decided to retain some of the original theme. They aren't all that bad. \r\n\r\n",
