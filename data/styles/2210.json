{"id":2210,"info":{"name":"Flashes on Newgrounds at Full Screen (100%)","description":"Just a short but efficient style to able to watch Flash games or movies on www.newgrounds.com without ads and at the full size of the window.\r\n\r\nTo open a flash at full-screen with this style, click on the Pop-up link in the movie/game page and in the opened window, press F11 before clicking on the flash. To exit, click on the windows keyboard button, then right-click on the firefox task in the taskbar which the flash page is opened and choose close. You can use Alt-Tab to naviguate between windows.\r\n\r\nNote : Slow computers will read flashes even slower!\r\n\r\nFuture : I will try to do a style for the \"pop-in\" way to open flashes but this is a lot more difficult. style 3103 by user 202 does that but is not complete (margins problems and lack of the usefull x button).","format":"uso","category":"newgrounds","updatedAt":"2008-02-10T11:41:29.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":2405,"name":"Szeety"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1596,"weekly":2}},"screenshots":{"isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/viewer.php\") {\r\n div, embed{\r\n  width:100% !important;\r\n  height:100% !important;\r\n  padding:0 !important;\r\n }\r\n .boxtop, .headsizer, .hr, .popadtext, br, .boxbot\r\n  {display:none !important;}\r\n}"}}
