    "description": "This style removes these sharing links by hiding the containing element.  Share links are removed both from the main index and individual article pages.",
    "additionalInfo": "Note: This only remove share links. For a more complete set of fixes, see my other style: style 115521.\r\n\r\nSometime around January 25th 2010, Slashdot's interface degenerated even further with the addition of \"share links\" at the bottom of every story.  These completely pointless links currently point to Facebook and Twitter and do nothing except clutter up the interface.\r\n\r\nThis style removes the sharing-related elements from the main story index and individual article pages.\r\n\r\nUpdate Nov 2012:\r\n\r\nEdited to include the stupid new links that appear on comment mouse hover.\r\n\r\nUpdate June 2015:\r\n\r\nShare links on the main page were changed to drop-down crapfest. Also removes \"Share\" link on every story comment.\r\n\r\nKeywords: slashdot remove share links facebook twitter sharing interface",
