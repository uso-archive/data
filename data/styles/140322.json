    "additionalInfo": "The Daily Mail is a British daily middle-market tabloid newspaper owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust and published in London. First published in 1896 by Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe, and his brother Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, it is the United Kingdom's second biggest-selling daily newspaper after The Sun. Its sister paper The Mail on Sunday was launched in 1982. Scottish and Irish editions of the daily paper were launched in 1947 and 2006 respectively. The Daily Mail was Britain's first daily newspaper aimed at the newly literate \"lower-middle class market resulting from mass education, combining a low retail price with plenty of competitions, prizes and promotional gimmicks\", and was the first British paper to sell a million copies a day.",
