    "additionalInfo": "This this userstyle is mostly useless now, because 1-2 years after I made it, Google stopped highlighting matches within result titles (i.e. the entire title is now a single element). Without this match highlighting, I can only style the entire result title, rather than only bolding the match and leaving the rest non-bolded (like <a href=\"https://userstyles.org/style_screenshots/99159_after.png\">this screenshot from a 2014 version of this userstyle</a>).\r\n\r\nAlso, may not work during the initial pageload if you have Instant enabled and for some reason search from the home page.",
