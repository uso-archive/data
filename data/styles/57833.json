    "description": "Removes the left column, which is annoying with small displays. Even with 1024 in width, you have to scroll to the right to read the posts.\r\nSo even while just being a lurker on the noot' forum, I created this to be able to read more efficiently.\r\nThey should have made the column as a separately loaded script instead of being in the main file, then it could be blocked using Adblock Plus... Or just scrap it and use a horizontal menu at the top.",
