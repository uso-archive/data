{"id":57833,"info":{"name":"Longecity.org - Left Column Removal","description":"Removes the left column, which is annoying with small displays. Even with 1024 in width, you have to scroll to the right to read the posts.\r\nSo even while just being a lurker on the noot' forum, I created this to be able to read more efficiently.\r\nThey should have made the column as a separately loaded script instead of being in the main file, then it could be blocked using Adblock Plus... Or just scrap it and use a horizontal menu at the top.","format":"uso","category":"longecity","updatedAt":"2012-01-19T05:19:25.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":126362,"name":"luminatus"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":103,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"57833-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/*Made by Luminatus.
