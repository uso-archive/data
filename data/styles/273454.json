    "description": "Many people and companies are rounding the corners of their websites and software, but many people prefer sharper corners. This userstyle sharpens all corners of elements in websites.\r\n\r\n(Note: This may not work, but I am still working on it.)",
    "additionalInfo": "Note: This is in development.\r\n\r\nRelease notes:\r\nv1.1.0.4 - Started working on excluding <img> elements in case they interfere with other elements as a square instead of a circle. (Yes, I know that that was a terrible description.)\r\nv1.0.0.3 - Changed the logo to make the purpose of this userstyle more obvious.\r\nv1.0.0.2 - Proper capitalization in the title.\r\nv1.0.0.1 - First logo. Added corner sharpener using a wildcard (*).",
