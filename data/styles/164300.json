INTENT\r\n   The intention of this style is to resolve issues with the input box. It's a\r\n   poorly-optimized waste of space which could do with some touching up, though this\r\n   first version of input box fixes is also intended to be the most universal,\r\n   taking a lazy and ugly approach to resolving it.\r\n\r\n   II. ISSUES\r\n   The problem with this approach is, the buttons at the right side stretch to fit\r\n   the height of the text box. The only reason this is a problem is because the\r\n   default theme, Dawn uses box shadows, and due to how the interface is designed\r\n   changing the height of the buttons causes the appearance of the input box to\r\n   not look correct, which doesn't affect other themes. See next paragraph.\r\n\r\n   III. USE OF OTHER THEMES\r\n   If using another theme via IRCCloud's account settings, the code provided in\r\n   the next section will adjust the buttons to the right to be 30px wide and tall.\r\n   When reverting to Dawn theme, the undesired behaviour of having the buttons\r\n   active anywhere along the length of the text box is restored.\r\n*/\r\n}\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.irccloud.com\") {\r\n/* Adjust width of text box */\r\n.inputcell FORM {\r\n    width: calc(100% + 56px);\r\n}\r\n/* Make buttons show text under them\r\n   A/N: This is stupid.\r\n*/\r\n.nickinputcell DIV[role=\"button\"] {\r\n    background-color: transparent;\r\n}\r\nBODY.app:not(.theme-dawn) .nickinput DIV[role=\"button\"] {\r\n    height: 30px;\r\n}\r\n}"}}
