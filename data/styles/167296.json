    "description": "Its no secret that the Youtube comments are crap, but when a Youtube comment is so bad that it sometimes <b>vaguely relates to the video itself</b>, or <b>has been commented thousands of times on that video before you,</b> that's when you have a slight problem. This userstyle hides Justin Y's comments on YouTube, allowing you to read the comments without being pestered by his shit.",
    "additionalInfo": "There's no REAL way to hide people's comments due to Youtube's code, but we can use some hacky methods to hide all comments that are linked to Justin Y's channel (not mentioning Justin Y, actually posted by him). This hacky method comes at a cost, though: because of the way the code is structured, the \"View x replies\" button can't be hidden on Justin Y's comments specifically. To remedy this, this button is hidden by default until you hover over its respective parent comment. You can't hover over comments that are hidden with this style, so you won't see Justin Y's comments even accidentally.",
