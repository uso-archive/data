    "name": "IE9 style tab bar + Minimal space",
    "description": "With this style, you will be able to reduce the number of bars to only one bar giving you more place for your browsing.  A clean style.  It will also imitate the Internet Explorer 9 tabs bar by having the address field beside the tabs instead of above it eliminating a bar.",
    "additionalInfo": "Best used with FXChrome theme that you can get right here: https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/fxchrome/\r\n\r\nAlso used to move the Firefox app button (Moveble Firefox Button) that you can get here: https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/movable-firefox-button/\r\n\r\nI also used this CSS style for the windows min, max and close buttons: http://userstyles.org/styles/55689/app-window-controls-winxp-windows7-basic\r\n\r\nFor the presented setup, you need to do the following:\r\n\r\nPersonalise the bars by doing the following:\r\n1 - Move the address field in the tabs area left to the tabs\r\n2 - Move the next and previous buttons on the left of your newly positionned address field\r\n3 - Move the bookmarks button on the left of the previous and next buttons\r\n4 - Move the refresh and stop buttons on the right of the address bar in that order (Refresh button left of the Stop button)\r\n\r\nIf you are using the moveable Firefox Button extension, place that button to the right of the tabs.\r\n\r\nHide all other bars and apply this CSS style.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
