    "description": "****************\r\nImportant Update:\r\nAs of October 29th 2007:  Oh oh.  There are, as of today, TWO Versions of GMail.  To get these button colors, you will have to select \"Older Version\" in the top right corner.  The \"New\" Version has changed all button element types (class) to \".BuNwUe\" and the only delineation is \"textContent:  \"Archive\" for example.  So unless you select \"Older Version,\" this script will either fall by the wayside or I'll update it if possible when I have some time.\r\n\r\nAddendum 8:15PM PST - after 3 hours, I've managed to fix Bold Label Names and some Red Bold Text for Compose, Contacts, etc.  I've found some possible solution(s) for these button colors involving \"nodeValue,\" and will work on this more later this evening.\r\n\r\nThis may not be an issue for some of you, but I believe GMail will be updating for all users within next couple of days.  The GREAT news is . . . you've got another 1.5GB of storage, and the functionality is MUCH improved - they did a great job.  Contact photos are larger, and the contacts page is much more intuitive and editable!  Woo Hoo!  Go Google/Gmail.\r\n****************\r\n\r\nI compiled my scripts for RED \"Delete/Discard/Delete Forever,\" GREEN \"Send and Compose,\" YELLOW \"Archive & Save Now\" and BLUE \"Move to Inbox\" all into one script.   Added Search Button Colors and \"SPAM/Not Spam\" Oct 14th.  Combined with my \"bold label names\" it makes navigating GMail easier and more intuitive, and you're less likely to hit the wrong button or miss a label when combing through a lot of mail.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE that 3rd line from bottom removes the \"search web\" button.  I swear by Google & GMail, but don't search mail from my GMail so I don't have it.  If you WANT the Search Web Button, eliminate \"input[value*=\"web\"] {display: none !important; }\"",
