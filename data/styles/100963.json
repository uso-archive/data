{"id":100963,"info":{"name":"LiveJournal Error Page Edit","description":"A simple style that changes the creepy goat on the LiveJournal error page to a sad cartoon character, which gets the point across without being disturbing (although you can change the image by replacing the bit.ly url in the code if you would prefer a different picture). Huge thanks to qwerty321 for making a joke error page so I could take some of the code for this style and to cartoonfaces.net for the stock picture.","format":"uso","category":"livejournal","updatedAt":"2014-04-29T23:23:22.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":263855,"name":"SharonaParadox"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":138,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"100963_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"livejournal.com\") {\r\n.error-page .pic {\r\n    width: 0px !important;\r\n    padding-right: 370px !important;\r\n    left: -50px !important;\r\n    background-image: url('http://bit.ly/1fNWgHJ') !important;\r\n    background-repeat: no-repeat !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}}
