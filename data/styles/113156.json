    "name": "Multi-Column Spanning Widescreen Google Results",
    "description": "Columnized (or 'boxified'?) search results. Great for huge monitors or widescreen TVs. I have a 3200x1080 desktop, so I hated the fact that all my search results only occupied the 15% of the left side of the screen while the rest lay unused on the right* The style in the preview is combined with \"Darker Google\" by Zigboom Designs.",
    "additionalInfo": "*=by 'unused on the right' i actually mean 'used by all those ads'.. its not like I use an ad blocker  that viciously removes any and all ads and is called adblock+ aka 'ABP', or anything like that :)\r\n- v1.1 \"the-very-next-day-fixed-stuff-that-was-apparently-wrong-bugfixes\"\r\n- Fixed google's 'you did this wrong' cues from mixing with results (appearing under first last boxes)\r\n- Kinda fixed the long ending BUT... google does modify this en route so ive noticed if stylish doesnt change it after google dynamically changes the column to not float, it ends up having a huge space at the end. There is nothing I can do about that save writing a greasemonkey script and thats just not worth it. I made it so the 1 2 3 4 5 6 bar (is that what its called?) appears right under the results, so unless you are dying to read the copyright messages, you shouldnt suffer much.\r\n- v1.0\r\n- Intended For Mozilla-Based Browsers (for now)  tested with firefox 35+, komodo 8\r\n- written quickly by gabriel sharp (osirisgothra@hotmail.com)\r\n- uses some experimental phase CSS (-moz-) to grid-ize/columnize search results\r\n- doing this required me to hide the footer stuff.... so yeah i know it has that (but who cares, we have columns now!!! yay!)\r\n- uses NO filter elements or other performance-degrading css elements!\r\n- public domain\r\n- spelling, grammar, and other mistakes in the text is intentional because I am human and we need to remeber not to submit to such tools lest our handwriting look worse than our kids' 3rd grade handwriting, which is still pretty bad since they are already using computers at school at that age. By intended, i mean the not using autochecking tools, not the mistakes themselves. (btw, I'd post this at the end of most of my new descriptions whenver I can remember to do it).",
