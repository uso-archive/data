    "description": "USE THIS STYLE ONLY IF YOU HAVE GOOGLE MUSIC SET TO RUN AS A STANDALONE APP THROUGH FLUID.\r\n\r\nIf you need icons for your custom Fluid apps, I have a few available for download on deviantART. Here's the url to my page: http://daveyjake.deviantart.com/",
    "additionalInfo": "FOR A HASSLE-FREE SETUP...\r\n\r\n(1) When you launch Google Music through Fluid, go to the PREFERENCES menu and select the USERSTYLES portion. Be sure to set the URL PATTERN to \"*music.google.com/*\" (without quotes); and if haven't already done so, copy & paste code into the box below the URL pattern.\r\n\r\n(2) In PREFERENCES under ADVANCED SETTINGS, make sure you ALLOW browsing to URL pattern \"*.google.com/*\" (without quotes). It prevents Firefox/Chrome/Safari from launching if you're not already logged in to Google.\r\n\r\nIf you find any bugs or have any requests, please let me know in the forums below.\r\n\r\nAlso be sure to check out my other styles by clicking on my username: user 17031",
