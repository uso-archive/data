MySpace BandView hides those parts of the site that aren't useful to us, and tidies a few things up.\r\n\r\nHere's what it does:\r\n1) Hides the background image - makes for faster scrolling\r\n2) Hides the MySpace-specific contact table\r\n3) Hides the list of MySpace friends\r\n4) Hides the MySpace friend comments\r\n5) Makes some of the text bigger* (when the default is too small)\r\n\r\n*: I'd like some help to get this working better. I've spent too much time working on it already. Maybe at some point I'll have interest in doing it myself, but it will get fixed sooner if I get help.\r\nThe following is either too small, or irregulary sized:\r\nGeneral Info: Band Website, Band Members, Influences, Sounds Like\r\nUpcoming Shows: heading, \"view all\" link, venues.\r\n\r\nThis style isn't perfect. If you send me corrections and suggestions, I would be happy to take them into consideration for posting an update. My contact information is on my website, http://danrasmussen.org/contact\r\n\r\nTo do at some point:\r\nFix text sizes (see above)\r\nWiden page (left and right margins are rather large.\r\nMake links stand out a bit (not always easy to tell from text).\r\nMake section headers smaller.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in blocking ads or flash, look up the Firefox plugins \"AdBlock\" and \"NoScript\".",
