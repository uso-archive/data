    "additionalInfo": "this is a very simple piece of coding that sets certain css elements to display as none on paintberri. this means you won't be able to see how many favorites are on any post on the site, or any other stats on posts. if you want to see that, you can toggle the style off then turn it back on when you're done.\r\n\r\ni couldn't figure out how to get rid of the counts next to comment favorites without getting rid of them entirely. if you figure something out, let me know on paintberri. my username is wren there.",
