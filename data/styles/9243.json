{"id":9243,"info":{"name":"Douban - Fixed-width Font (for Programmers)","description":"By replacing default font-family's on Douban (豆瓣: www.douban.com and www.douban.net) with a Fixed-width Font best for programmers, you can read in a proper manner all articles including source code.\r\n\r\nThis CSS is so simple that you can hack it by yourself into whatever you like with your favorite Fixed-width font on your Mac or Linux computer.  Here I just set to DejaVu Sans Mono and Courier New.\r\n\r\nIn the future I'm *NOT* making it work over the very areas that showing multi-lined text but the whole Douban site.  Whenever you hate it, just turn OFF this style with your Stylish/GreaseMonkey button on the status-bar (if you leave the button there).","format":"uso","category":"douban","updatedAt":"2008-08-12T05:59:51.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":12783,"name":"Lam Edh"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":703,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"9243-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"douban.com\"), domain(\"douban.net\")\r\n{\r\n\r\n* {font-family: DejaVu Sans Mono, Courier New !important }\r\n\r\n}"}}
