    "description": "edit: this no longer works since they change their site layout (I am working on a new script)\r\n\r\nOne annoying part of consumerist is that it does not make use of the additional space given with wide screen displays. This is especially annoying on IPS monitors where the background that fills the rest of the screen space will for the most part remain static between articles, causing a very annoying image retention issue.\r\n\r\nOverall, I wrote a script that will allow it to make use of more of the screen space. available, and also have the added benefit of supporting smaller displays or smaller browser windows by dynamically resizing the various elements on the page.",
