{"id":17337,"info":{"name":"Drupal.org: Strong issue-state colors","description":"Issues on the drupal.org project tracker are colored by state (active, needs review, fixed, etc.). These state colors are very close to white, and cannot be easily distinguished on most monitors.\r\n\r\nThis stylesheet will assign stronger colors, as well as striking through the text on closed issues. Be aware that this will make the tracker pages very colorful and not very pretty; the style is strictly utilitarian. The colors I picked for the many closed states (duplicate, by design, won't fix) are highly arbitrary and you may want to customize these. As the state classes are only numbered, the inline comments indicate which state is being changed, and what the color looks like.","format":"uso","category":"drupal","updatedAt":"2009-04-27T07:58:04.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":18052,"name":"Arancaytar","paypalEmail":"christoph@burschka.de"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":237,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"17337_after.gif","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"drupal.org\") {\r\n  /* needs work: rose */\r\n  .state-13 *, .project-issue-status-13 a {\r\n    background-color:#f98;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* needs review: yellow */\r\n  .state-8 *, .project-issue-status-8 a {\r\n    background-color:#fd8;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* rtbc: pale green */\r\n  .state-14 *, .project-issue-status-14 a {\r\n    background-color:#bfb;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* committed/fixed: green, stricken */\r\n  .state-2 *, .project-issue-status-2 a {\r\n    background-color:#6f6;\r\n    text-decoration:line-through;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* closed: lilac, stricken */\r\n  .state-7 *, .project-issue-status-7 a {\r\n    background-color:#c8f;\r\n    text-decoration:line-through;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* dupe: lighter lilac, stricken, italic */\r\n  .state-3 *, .project-issue-status-3 a {\r\n    background-color:#dbf;\r\n    text-decoration:line-through;\r\n    font-style:italic;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* postponed: blue, stricken */\r\n  .state-4 *, .project-issue-status-4 a {\r\n    background-color:#99f;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* by design: turquois, stricken */\r\n  .state-6 *, .project-issue-status-6 a {\r\n    background-color:#9ff;\r\n    text-decoration:line-through;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* won't fix: turquois, stricken */\r\n  .state-5 *, .project-issue-status-5 a {\r\n    background-color:#9ff;\r\n    text-decoration:line-through;\r\n  }\r\n}"}}
