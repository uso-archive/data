    "description": "KILLA METHOD is a new Roblox beaming method made by me(Kashi)\r\n\r\nThe method goes as following:\r\n 1: You download this style which will give you a fake Robux amount.\r\n 2: Find a victim that is wanting to sell a account or something else Roblox related for it.\r\n 3: Screenshare and refresh the page to show them you have the Robux which is obviously fake.\r\n 4: Tell them to go first they most likely will since you showed ''proof'' of Robux.\r\n\r\nBoom easy beams, works best on dumb people but it has potential with rich people aswell.\r\n\r\nMaker: ! ùò¨‚ú∞ùò¥ùò©ùò™#6351\r\nDISCLAIMER: Clicking the Robux icon will reveal the real Robux amount.",
