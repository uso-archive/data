I know this is cooler than the ARC logo, that was sort of the point.\r\nAnd, I promise that this man(er, woman, actually) made anomaly won't destroy anything.\r\nAlso, yes, it does go a bit lower than most icons would, and I was going to fix that, but it's an anomaly, I thought it was fitting.\r\nEDIT: I fixed the weird repeating pattern that was on the bottom! I guess I just didn't really notice it for a while. Whoops!",
