    "description": "Phoronix's layout is . . .  distracting, to say the least. This makes for a less-pleasant reading experience. This style aims to correct that.\r\n\r\nWhat it does:\r\n\r\n* Hides the ad at the left side of the page\r\n* Hides the ad in the \"leaderboard\" at the top of the page\r\n* Hides the headers of the various sections at the right of the screen.\r\n* Hides the background image, which looks awful in 16-bit color depth.\r\n\r\nWhat it does not do:\r\n\r\n* Hide the ad at the bottom of the page -- hiding this with CSS would hide the copyright notice.\r\n* Hide the ad at the right side of the page -- hiding this with CSS would hide the recent stories and many other useful things.\r\n\r\nThis is version 1.0. I may later rearrange parts of the site as I did with my \"Kerneltrap -- Simplified\" style (22730)",
