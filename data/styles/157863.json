    "additionalInfo": "3/31/18 - I sort of just copy and pasted the code from the Closedverse version of this I made, so this may or may not work.\r\nA few minutes later - Never mind. Like what happened with the Closedverse theme, it worked.\r\n8/6/18 - Now comments work with this theme. Hurray! That took me longer to figure out than it should have.",
