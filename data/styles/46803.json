    "name": "Reduce YouTube video suggestions to 8 suggestions",
    "description": "This style reduces the number of video suggestions on YouTube to 8 videos, because the rest often has few in common with the video. Together with my style 41782, this also saves a lot of space.\r\n\r\nIf 8 is too few or too much for you, feel free change the \"9\" within \"n+9\" in the code to your preferred value.\r\n\r\nIn case you really want to have more suggestions for a video, you can click the button \"Load more suggestions\", whose suggestions will be displayed.\r\n\r\nOccasional HideMyAss watchers might find style 46805 useful.\r\n\r\nstyle 75661 combines this style with style 41782 along with some other tweaks.",
