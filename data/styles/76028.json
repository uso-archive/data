    "description": "Thunderbird: Resize the Calendar Toolbar and the Tasks Toolbar in Thunderbird. Both (which occupy the same position and shape... but exist on different TB tabs) are overly large in my opinion, and thus here is a way to shrink them smaller. You probably won't have a calendar toolbar though unless you have first installed the Lightning addon (calendar).",
    "additionalInfo": "The code is well enough commented that you should be able to figure out what is going on, and make your own changes.\r\n\r\nPlease note: Changes might be permanent... well not really, as you can adjust the userstyle itself to reEnlarge the Toolbar. But simply disabling the userstyle may not revert to the old size.\r\n\r\nPS ~ I'm using the Charamel theme, and this userstyle works nicely with that, and the \"Rise of the Tools\" tb-addon as well.\r\n\r\nKeywords: tasks toolbar, too big, too large, decrease the size, shrink the size, etc...",
