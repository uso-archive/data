    "additionalInfo": "v01 - mostly works, has issues with images and furigana.  Tested on latest Chrome 2019-08-21.  Ostensibly works in Firefox 53 but column height doesn't function properly so the words go right up to the edge of the screen.  Not sure why.  May fix later.  Have not tested in latest Firefox.\r\n\r\nv02 - Fixed margins in Firefox.  Made max column width smaller to make each section more \"page\" shaped.\r\n\r\nv03 - Changed column-gap to 16vh to make gaps between pages larger.\r\n\r\nv04 - Changed vh/vw values to be multiples of 5.  With units I had before such as \"16vh\", at fullscreen in 1080p this equates to .16 * 1080px = 172.8px.  With multiples of 5, everything divides better, hopefully avoiding pixel-perfect problems with scrolling and such.\r\n\r\nv05 - Changed regex to (broadly) allow for when the link has some subclass value after the \".html\".",
