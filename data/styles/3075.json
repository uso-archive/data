{"id":3075,"info":{"name":"Remove 'Spoilers!' label from FAQs","description":"I was really annoyed with the 'Spoilers!' label that is obscuring some of the entries in FAQ subsection of the movie page (it might appear in other places too, I don't know) - you have to hover the mouse over the entry to make it visible. I removed the label and instead coloured the 'spoiler' entries red, so it's still easy to distinguish spoilers from non spoilers.","format":"uso","category":"imdb","updatedAt":"2007-08-02T03:02:25.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":3571,"name":"V-smund"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":392,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"3075_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"imdb.com\") {\r\n\r\n.spoiler {  background-image: none !important;\r\n            border: none !important;}\r\n\r\n.spoiler span {visibility: visible !important;\r\n               color:red !important;}\r\n\r\n}"}}
