    "additionalInfo": "I kept the sidebar because honestly, the website condemned itself to poor design out of teh gate and I was too lazy to unscrew the rest of their site. This also removes the top margins on the sidebar as I believe in letting webmasters use unobtrusive ads, but autoplaying video bollocks is something I hate with a burning passion.",
