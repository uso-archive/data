{"id":16332,"info":{"name":"New Facebook' - Minimize/Simplify Highlights Area","description":"This style does two main things:\r\n\r\n1) It shortens the 'highlights' area found on the home page after the most recent update, and adds a scroll bar. This makes it a bit easier to see the items found beneath the highlights area (like pokes, friends you may know, etc.)\r\n\r\n2) It removes the image/video preview pictures found with each highlight story. Again, I didn't find the previews to add anything useful to it, and this is a little more space efficient.","format":"uso","category":"facebook","updatedAt":"2009-03-23T18:02:13.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":11558,"name":"aedes"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1679,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"16332-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"facebook.com\") {\r\n\r\n.UIHotStream.UIStream {\r\n  height:180px!important;\r\n  overflow-y:auto!important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.UIHotStory_Media {\r\n  display:none!important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n"}}
