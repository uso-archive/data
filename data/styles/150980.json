    "description": "Kills the Funimation adblock Overlay network!!!! Side benefit, won't turn off subtitles after ad plays...'cause ads don't play!  >:-)\r\n\r\nSide Note: Can't click on any links or linked images on the player but I find that a fine trade off.\r\n\r\nAdded some darker elements. I'll look into the comments section at some point.",
    "additionalInfo": "Seems this is an added benefit to also running AdBlock. AdBlock keeps an ad from loading, Funimation senses your ad blocker and puts up an overlay to cover the video asking for you to stop running your ad blocker. This style makes the overlay impossibly tiny so it doesn't obscure the video.",
