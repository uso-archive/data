    "description": "This user style sets the maximum width of Wikipedia's pages to 974px in an effort to improve readability for users whose web browsers have wide viewports.",
    "additionalInfo": "The reason the max width is set specifically to 974px is because 974px seems to be the greatest width that is commonly used by web designers when creating layouts.[1][2] So most users should already be accustomed to this width.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n[1] 974px is currently the greatest width that Yahoo includes in <a href=\"http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/\">YUI</a>, which is Yahoo's user interface library for web designers.\r\n\r\n[2] According to <a href=\"http://browsersize.googlelabs.com/\">Google Browser Size</a>, 90% of Google's users currently have a browser viewport that is at least 974px wide. So web designers will likely continue targeting this width into the near future.",
