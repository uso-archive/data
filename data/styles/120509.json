    "description": "Simple style, that removes a lot of the clutter from the sidebar in Google Drive.\r\n\r\nI often use laptops with very short screens, so when I try to drag files to the trash and the folder structure opens, the trash can scrolls behind the usage stats and I can't drop it in. This fixes that problem by removing all of the features I don't use from the Drive sidebar. Feel free to download and edit any of the buttons back in if you want them. Just comment out the appropriate line(s).",
    "additionalInfo": "New 5/29/2016: The Google bar is collapsed out of view by default. The only header on the page is the Google Drive bar (with the current folder's path in the center). The Google bar can be expanded by hovering over the top 10px of the screen.\r\nNew 8/29/2016: fixed the Google bar being placed weirdly and sidebar items not being removed when they should be\r\nNew 1/10/2017: Fix selectors for removing items in the sidebar",
