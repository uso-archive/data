    "description": "Makes the font slightly smaller for the Kanban card titles, and allows them to be up to two lines (instead of just one truncated line.)",
    "additionalInfo": "This customization is not perfect, but it seems to work well enough. \r\n\r\nThe Kanban cards are draggable, so Airtable is using position: absolute, and manually calculating the height of each card. This made it very difficult to override the CSS. However, I was able to expand the card height so that it used some of the margin between the cards. The cards are much closer together now, but I think it's worth it for the multi-line titles.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I can't add any more lines to the title without having access to the JavaScript source code.",
