    "description": "Inbox &mdash; https://inbox.google.com/ &mdash;  styles can always be improved. This simple style currently changes the background of the sidebar to white.\r\n\r\nThe sidebar is now kept open or closed and remembers its state when you re-visit, I have removed all styles which are now redundant",
    "additionalInfo": "Always Show Inbox Sidebar -- Now known as Better Google Inbox\r\n\r\nUpdated after markup change\r\n\r\nV 2\r\n\r\n- White background is back! Why would Google think it should be grey?!\r\n- The sidebar is now kept open or closed and remembers the it's stat when you re-visit, I have removed all styles which are now redundant\r\n\r\nV 1.3.6\r\n\r\n- Fixed hidden sidebar after code change by Google\r\n\r\nV 1.3.5\r\n\r\n- Fixed centre column offset after layout change\r\n\r\nV 1.3.4\r\n\r\n- Updated CSS paths after markup change by Google\r\n\r\nV 1.3.3\r\n\r\n- Now applied to all URLs for the domain \"inbox.google.com\"\r\n\r\nV 1.3.2\r\n\r\n - Fixed center column after layout change\r\n\r\nV 1.3.1\r\n\r\n- Styles are now applied through CSS paths and not classes which can change. Hopefully it wont keep breaking now! :D\r\n\r\nV 1.2 \r\n\r\n- Fixed after class changes by Google\r\n\r\n- Always Show now only applies after 1000px browser width\r\n\r\nV 1.1 \r\n\r\n- When the window size is smaller than 932px, normal sidebar behaviour is restored and it will hide by default. This prevents the sidebar overlapping the centre content column\r\n\r\n- Sidebar is no longer underneath the titlebar when always shown is active\r\n\r\n- Centre content  column is now correctly offset to account for sidebar width \r\n\r\n- Hamburger menu icon fades in and out when hidden\r\n\r\nV 1.0 - basic, needs to be improved.",
