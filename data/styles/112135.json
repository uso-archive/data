    "description": "This CSS hides the \"Invite\" and \"Connect\" links that appears on the \"People You May Know\" section of LinkedIn pages.\r\n\r\nI am annoyed that LinkedIn tries to get me to add people in my address book to LinkedIn.  I am happy to let them search my address book to find people *already in LinkedIn* who I could connect to, but I don't want to accidentally spam others in my address book.",
    "additionalInfo": "In 2017, LinkedIn made a complete revamp of their site, making the \"Invite\" and \"Connect\" buttons CSS-identical, so I cannot remove one without removing the other.  (Eff-off LinkedIn.) If you want to connect with a person, click on their name, and hit the \"Connect\" link from there.",
