    "name": "Remember The Milk - Tag Cloud Line Spacing",
    "description": "Based on this excellent idea found in RTM's forum:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rememberthemilk.com/forums/tips/2943/\r\n\r\nI've been using my task cloud as a nicely formatted way to get to what normally I would need a smartlist for.  Clicking on a tag creates an automatic smartlist of sorts.  It's only a one-dimensional smartlist that looks for the given tag, but having your cloud formatted in such a way makes creating things like on-the-fly context lists easy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is all a hack and so you can't introduce spacing to help seperate the various sections out.  So in order to make things a bit more readable, I've created this small script which increases the line-spacing for all the lines within the cloud.",
