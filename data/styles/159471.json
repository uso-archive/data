    "description": "Allows you to temporarily hide the stats on your artworks or stories, if desired, because sometimes you might need a break from all the analytical stuff like I do and want to just get back to drawing/writing without any sort of inhibitions!",
    "additionalInfo": "Due to the code to make it work, it also applies to everybody else's works while it's on, but you can easily deactivate it to remedy that problem. Of course, that logic applies for your own works too - if you want to see the stats again, simply deactivate this and viola, back to normal! :) That's all it is - It's just a tool to use for your own comfort if you want to.",
