    "description": "How to replace the original thumbnails with your own images on about:newtab <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/5VjCpwQ.png\">here is one example</a>\r\n\r\nThis userstyle is supposed to be used together with my style <a href=\"https://userstyles.org/styles/70561/glassfox-choose-your-personal-newtab\">GlassFox - choose your personal NewTab</a>\r\nTo simplify it, you can handle all your thumbnails in a separate style. That's the purpose of this userstyle.\r\nBenefits doing that is: \r\n1. easier to manage, \r\n2. protect your thumbnails when your about:newtab-style is updated in the future (otherwise they would have been wiped out ...),  \r\n3. your thumbnails can be used together with the original about:newtab page, or an another style (independent my style) if you like.",
    "additionalInfo": "<b><mark>Note:</mark> You are expected to enter your thumbnails yourself</b>, just follow the simple templates and edit the file.\r\n\r\nUpdated April 23, 2017: <b>If you have used the older version this style earlier</b>, as an update will wipe out your personal added info I suggest that you open your current file and <b>copy all your own entries</b> to NotePad or any other text editor <b>before</b> you hit the update-button to this style.\r\nAfter the update, just copy/paste back your own entries again in the updated file. Sorry for any inconvenience.",
