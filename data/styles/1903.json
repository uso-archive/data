    "description": "todoist is a simple yet effective todolist. it delivers a fast \"FLOW\" that makes it more productive (for me) than \"old\" players like tadalist and remember the milk. \r\nsince i like my apps a bit more colorful i decided to \"pimp\" it out a bit. i was going for that cool roughunderbelly.com look.\r\ncame out kinda nifty :)\r\n\r\noron mizrachi (requests - mail_me [AT] nana.co.il)\r\n\r\nto Aliji - in order to replace the logo you'll have to give the #logo>IMG visibility hidden and then give your own logo by attaching a background image to the logo container. that should do it. i did on my delicious vibes skin. you should check it out. enjoy the skin :)",
