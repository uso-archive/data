{"id":292,"info":{"name":"Visited Links PNG Image (based on marcanth's)","description":"Many thanks to marcanth, and his source Roger Johansson, for a GREAT script I've already given 5 stars.  Problem was I couldn't get the image to work, and then found a character map symbol which worked in Stylish, but not in userContent.  I've put the image BEFORE the link, and rewritten the code more precisely  thanks to Pawe� Kubisz (cyberrus) and the PDF icon script  (\"a[href]\") - and come up with this PNG/base 64 version which works BOTH in Stylish and userContent.  I'm grateful to marcanth for finding this as now, even with my black background Google IMage Search script in effect, I still get an indicator of \"visited image\" as well as links (see screenshots).","format":"uso","category":"global","updatedAt":"2006-04-20T18:54:52.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","paypalEmail":"paulbrit@gmail.com"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":2418,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"292_after.gif","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":8,"commentsCount":8}},"style":{"css":"/*Coded by Paulfox April 20th 2006, based on original script by marcanth */\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\na[href]:visited:before { content: url(\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAkAAAAMCAYAAACwXJejAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAGElEQVQYlWP8b2z8n4EAYCKkYFTRQCgCADY%2BAnyGRbu9AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\");  padding-right:5px; }"}}
