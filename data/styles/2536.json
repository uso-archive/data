    "description": "This style tweaks the BetterSearch \"preview\" box.  It changes:\r\n\r\n1) the margin color\r\n2) the border size and color\r\n3) width and height\r\n\r\nThe width and height are set for the search results (indented and unindented) as seen on a resolution of 1680x1050.  I might suggest that you play around with these values to better suit your needs, especially if you have a screen resolution different from that.\r\n\r\nI might suggest that you apply this in combination with one of my other styles style 2535, which does not break this style's layout.\r\n\r\n(06-23-07 - Updated to include topic specific Google search results: Linux, BSD, & microsoft)\r\n(03-08-08 - Updated to include the inexplicable addition of the \"http://www.l.google.com\" domain)\r\n(09-02-08 - Updated to a resolution of 1680x1050 and to reflect change in Google code)\r\n(09-10-08 - Updated code to improve improve implementation)",
