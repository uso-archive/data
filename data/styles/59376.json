    "description": "I use Yahoo Mail for one thing: mail. I don't use the calendar, or the notebook, or the eleventy hundred facebook and other flavor-of-the-week apps. I don't want to run a Yahoo search or update my im status or look at obnoxious branding images. I just want to see my inbox, the emails I'm composing, and that's it.\r\n\r\nThis style strips out everything except for your actual mail, so you can focus on your messages instead of the distracting bits and bobs of the new interface. You'll save quite a bit of vertical space as well.",
    "additionalInfo": "I use the keyboard shortcut, n, for composing new messages and I don't use custom folders, so in the interest of keeping things minimal, I've stripped out these items by default. To get them back, though, just follow the directions below.\r\n\r\nFor the wide \"Compose Message\" button and the dropdown button beside it, delete the following lines:\r\nspan#main-btn-new,\r\nspan#btn-new,\r\n(The first line gets rid of the \"Compose Message\" button and the second line gets rid of the dropdown. Since they both do the same thing, you can keep one and not the other if you like.)\r\n\r\nUse the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+[ and Ctrl+] to access your Contacts.\r\n\r\nUpdated March 28th, 2012:\r\n\r\nUpdated custom folder code to kill the new smart folders as well as the old-school custom folders. If you want them back, just delete the following line:\r\n[id*=folders-nav],\r\n\r\nMessage headers are redundant. The exact same information is available in the message list directly above it, so why waste those precious vertical pixels? If you want them back, just delete the following line:\r\n.message-header,\r\n\r\nAdjusted margins and paddings in a bunch of places to increase the overall viewing area. \r\n\r\nNow includes search by default. I trimmed off the ugly Yahoo branding buttons and snuck it into the bottom left corner, where it won't interfere with your reading / composing and won't waste any vertical space.\r\n\r\nI have a brand new version of this style in the works that is even more brutal than this one. Expect it in the next couple days.",
