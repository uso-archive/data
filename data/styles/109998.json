    "additionalInfo": "With the recent Tumblr update (most recent as of 1st Feb 2015), one change I didn't see addressed by the community is the expanded spacing between the lines of text and between paragraphs. I can see how it might benefit some, but for a user who is resistant to change and susceptible to headaches from too wide spacing, this is a huge bother. So this style opts to change the line-heights and the margins of the dashboard. \r\n\r\nIf I've missed anything that needs re-spacing or anything, please let me know as soon as possible so I can modify accordingly!\r\n\r\nV1.0: The initial release, 1st Feb 2015.",
