Click on the Stylish plug-in and search for additional active themes for Roblox (Usually caused by themes that customize the entirety of the websites appearance).\r\n\r\n2. Enter edit mode on said themes by clicking the pencil icon below the themes title on the left.\r\n\r\n3. Search for a section in the code listed under \".avatar-back\" and delete it.\r\n\r\n4. You will need to save the updated code (Button near top left of page) to update it.\r\n\r\nIf you continue to have problems with the avatar background not appearing correctly for you please check any other active themes or consider the possibility that it might not be compatible with your browser/device.",
