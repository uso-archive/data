{"id":337,"info":{"name":"Center all pages","description":"Centers ALL pages.\r\nWARNING: Messes up the layout of many pages (including userstyles.org) that don't have a layout based on tables. To prevent that, remove the margin-left and margin-right settings (page will only be centered vertically afterwards).\r\n\r\nEdit: Good to see this style is still liked (and still works in Firefox 3.0). And it doesn't seem to break this site any more, either.\r\nThanks for the reviews. I don't think you can add exceptions for single pages. Also, this style might break in future versions because changing the style of the HTML node is sort of a hack and is afaik not standards conform.\r\nWell, whatever, keep enjoying it as long as possible.","format":"uso","category":"global","updatedAt":"2006-05-03T07:29:17.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":194,"name":"derula"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":4016,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"337_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":5,"commentsCount":5}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n  height:100% !important;\r\n  display:table !important;\r\n  margin-left: auto !important;\r\n  margin-right: auto !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbody {\r\n  display:table-cell !important;\r\n  vertical-align: middle !important;\r\n}"}}
