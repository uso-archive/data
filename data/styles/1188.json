Every little bit helps!\r\n\r\nWhile long descriptions about each add-on you're interested in is awesome, when you're not interested... they're a pain.\r\n\r\nThis sets each add-on's description to a maximum height, and if it's longer than the max a scroll bar is created.\r\n\r\nInspired by the \"Forums - Limit Post Sizes\" style.\r\n\r\nOn parts of the Mozilla Add-ons site, they've redone the layout (Thanks for pointing this out Valacar). I could have separated the two styles, but this is the shorter way.","format":"uso","category":"mozilla","updatedAt":"2006-10-27T03:34:31.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":911,"name":"Amanda Kerik"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":896,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"1188_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":3,"commentsCount":3}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"addons.mozilla.org\") {\r\n.item, .corner-box {display: block !important; overflow: auto !important; outline: none !important;}\r\n\r\n.item .first, .desc {max-height: 15em !important;}\r\n.baseline {display: none !important;}\r\n}"}}
