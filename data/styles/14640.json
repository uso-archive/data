    "description": "This is an edited version of ( Gmail logon - minimized ) at ( http://userstyles.org/styles/172 ) except this version works for Google Apps login pages.\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at a userstyle, so if it does not work for you... I'm very very sorry!!! (really) I built this because I hate looking at all the text on the log in page EVERY FREAKING time I log into the website (which is about a bazillion times a week). Sad shame Google cannot make us have our own custom log in page without having to hack up their own website just to have a clean website. Like I really want everybody in my company to have to look at all that crap text every time they want to log in too. Sigh, come on Google.\r\n\r\nAnyway, please post a comment if this does not work for you, or if you have any suggestions/fixes. I am not exactly a CSS master - or even close. Took me about an hour to hack this together LOL. I will try my best to fix anything that does not work for you... but no promises.\r\n\r\n**** Update: 2/8/2009 8:00 PM *****\r\n\r\nI just discovered that this will cause the Google Dashboard to go crazy. I am trying to figure out how to exclude the /cpanel/ within the url-prefix. As soon as I figure that out I will update this script so it does not cause the Dashboard to have issues.",
