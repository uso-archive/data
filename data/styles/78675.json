    "name": "Reddit: Always Show Downvote Arrows",
    "description": "Note: No longer updated; I don't have the time (no matter how small) nor interest to continue maintaining the userstyle, but it works for most subreddits in its current state.\r\n\r\nSome subreddits find it necessary to remove downvote arrows, ruining the spirit of reddit and hindering the community's involvement in the promotion/demotion of content.  Take back control.\r\n\r\nBonus: This UserStyle also forces the 'report' button and upvote arrows to always be visible.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n<b>Found a subreddit without downvote arrows?</b>\r\nThis code should cover every subreddit possible; however, if you happen to find a sneaky subreddit that managed to find a way around it feel free to contact me (see below) with the subreddit so I can make code additions/adjustments.\r\n\r\nLeave feedback in the <i>Discussions</i> or PM me on reddit (<a href=\"http://reddit.com/user/zants\">zants</a>) if you have any tips or helpful suggestions. :)",
    "additionalInfo": "<i>Changelog:\r\n07.22.2014: Updated picture.\r\n08.16.2013: Added code to combat /r/conspiracy.  Added code for upvote arrows as well.\r\n08.04.2013: Fixed code so it didn't ruin the reddit toolbar.  Touchups to the code as well as the style's description and name (for clarity).\r\n01.15.2013: Added code to always show 'report' to combat /r/mildlyinteresting.\r\n11.30.2012: Added code to combat /r/snes.\r\n11.24.2012: Removed \".arrow.down\" code as it was messing up the reddit toolbar.\r\n11.20.2012: Added code to combat /r/mashups and /r/RisingThreads.\r\n11.19.2012: Userstyle created.</i>",
