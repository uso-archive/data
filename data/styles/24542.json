Also have the social (facebook + share icons) bar hidden by default.\r\n6/10/10 - Added new Scene and cleaned up the stylesheet a bit to remove deprecated styles and so your homepage style selections are used.\r\n6/05/10 - Adapted the stylesheet for Atlas Pro as all other styles have been removed.\r\n1/25/10 - Changed some of the properties to remove extra (unneeded) lines as well as to differentiate my code from Browno's copy/pasta.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeowin Scenes - This will override any selection you make on the homepage. Also, if you want to make your own scene, the values to use are 990x135.\r\nhttp://neowin.net/images/header_images/dusk.jpg\r\nhttp://neowin.net/images/header_images/win7.jpg\r\nhttp://neowin.net/images/header_images/streamoflight.jpg\r\nhttp://neowin.net/images/header_images/bokeh.jpg\r\nhttp://neowin.net/images/header_images/quattuor.jpg\r\nhttp://neowin.net/images/header_images/floatingisland.jpg",
