    "description": "Well, Curse again did some really \"awesome\" changes on their sites, like their forum or the repository of mods. They were that awesome, they... Nah, not here.\r\n\r\nWhat does this style?\r\n\r\n• It widens the visibility\r\n• Hides places for ads (Still recommend Adblock, because hiding isn't blocking and so you will still notice some heavy lag - thanks to Curse.com for including a bunch of craploading javascripts!)\r\n• Fixes oversized avatars\r\n• Fixes oversized images\r\n• Fixes annoying long full-quotes (You still can scroll through, but the overview won't get destroyed anymore)\r\n• Fixes annoying long posts, since most users won't use the spoiler-button (Same method like before)\r\n• Many more things.\r\n\r\nWhat does this style NOT do?\r\n\r\n• Annoy you with fancy new graphics\r\n• Switching things that were not necessary\r\n• Brew a cup of coffee ;)",
    "additionalInfo": "I can't guarantee maintaining this style, because  am really worried about Curse.com. They now mean, javascript is there for all things. It isn't! God damnit, it's a board. Also worried about the stupid users, ignoring rules and common sense.\r\n\r\nI'll try to keep it alive as good as I can, but no promises.\r\n\r\nNo screenshots. Why? Simple: Userstyles requires me to bring the screenshots to <200KB. Impossible, since I hate cropping them down for nothing. Get yourself the script and decide.",
