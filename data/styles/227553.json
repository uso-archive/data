    "description": "Updated to work again.\r\n\r\nThis style shrinks the left sidebar (channels and friends) to 12px wide until you hover your cursor over it, which is when it expands to its full width.\r\n\r\nA 12px width will allow you to see the white indicator that shows that someone has sent a message in a channel, without taking up too much space.\r\n\r\nThis style should work for all future versions of Discord, and will also continue being maintained as I depend on it daily myself.\r\n\r\nThis style AVOIDS minimizing the sidebar in the settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso see my other styles for hiding \"Gift nitro\", \"Send stickers\", \"Send GIF\" and \"Send emojis\" buttons on the right hand side of the chatting input!",
    "additionalInfo": "04. may 2024\r\nv0.3 - Updated to work again.\r\n\r\n28. jan 2022\r\nv0.2 - Updated so that CSS targets all elements that starts with the class \"sidebar\", EXCEPT for \"nav\"-elements. This will make it so that the sidebar in the settings does not become minimized.\r\n\r\n26. jan 2022\r\nv0.1 - Published version that minimizes/hides the Channel and Friends sidebar. Tested on Chromium on Windows desktop.",
