    "additionalInfo": "This style was made to hide the message windows that plague many a Facebook user and to hide the Messages button, because the in-page messaging functionality in Facebook would become broken after applying this style.\r\n\r\nThis is not Javascript to make messaging useless, it just hides things you'd rather not be seeing concurrently with Pidgin, Trillian, Jabber, Facebook Messenger or some other messenger with XMPP / Jabber support.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make the message windows transparent instead, I made this real easy for the novice to do; Change line 6 from <i>display: none</i> to <i>opacity: 0.75</i>, remove line 5 (making line 6 become line 5) and play with it from there.",
