    "additionalInfo": "whitescreen.online is a great web app to black out a monitor quickly when needed (like when watching a video on the primary monitor). It does not have a built-in dark mode however when not blacked out, and the bright white default background  got annoying when sitting in a dark room, so I created this dark mode for those times when the page is sitting around waiting to be used. - ShaneX",
