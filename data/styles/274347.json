    "description": "This useful little lightweight webpage makes it super easy to quick put up an all-black screen on one or more monitors, just by clicking the box. However it ironically does not have its own dark mode, and the white background was irritating considering I mostly used the page at night, so I created my own dark mode. The site is MUCH more pleasing to the eyes at night now.  Enjoy!",
    "additionalInfo": "whitescreen.online is a great web app to black out a monitor quickly when needed (like when watching a video on the primary monitor). It does not have a built-in dark mode however when not blacked out, and the bright white default background  got annoying when sitting in a dark room, so I created this dark mode for those times when the page is sitting around waiting to be used. - ShaneX",

Then the 10th time, w/o\r\n  rewriting any code, the \"Save & Publish\" button FINALLY works.\r\n  I hope they find some way to get a skilled engineer on board\r\n  that is willing to help at least make the site usable. As it\r\n  sits it is such a waste of years of quality work.\r\n  \r\n  NOTE: If this style does not appear to work in browsers other than Firefox, it is because of the way the site forced the code to have a moz-document header. Chrome and Vivaldi users can just remove the first 2 lines, as well as the opening curly bracket on the 3rd line, and the closing curly bracket on the last line of css code. This was primarily developed and used on Google Chrome/Vivaldi so it should prove to work best in those browsers. Feel free to contact me in comments here or @ShaneX on X.com (Twitter) with any questions or bugs.\r\n*/\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n    background-color: #000000;\r\n    color: #696969;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbody {\r\n    background-color: #000000;\r\n    color: #696969;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh1, h2 {\r\n    color: #696969;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.site-name a {\r\n    color: #f0f0f0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.feedback {\r\n    color: #222222;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.lang-dropbtn {\r\n    background-color: #000000;\r\n    color: #222222;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.main-color {\r\n    box-shadow: 0 8px 30px 0 #3366ff;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbutton {\r\n    color: #424242;\r\n    background-color: #000000;\r\n    border: 1px solid #424242;\r\n    -webkit-border-radius: 3px;\r\n    -moz-border-radius: 3px;\r\n    border-radius: 3px;\r\n    margin: 0px 5px 0px 5px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.download-btn {\r\n    margin-top: 15px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#open-on-all-screens {\r\n    margin-bottom: 25px;\r\n}\r\n\r\nselect, input, label {\r\n    color: #222222;\r\n    border-bottom: 1px solid #222222 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.gallery a, .gallery-right-color, .color-right-text {\r\n    color: #424242;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {\r\n    .gallery-left {\r\n        padding-top: 0px;\r\n        padding-bottom: 0px;\r\n        padding-right: 10px;\r\n        width: 174px;\r\n    }\r\n    .color-block {\r\n        padding: 0px 0px 5px 0px;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.color-block-selected {\r\n    background-color: #1e2035;\r\n  }\n}\n",
