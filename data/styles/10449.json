    "description": "credits go out to:\r\n\r\n- style 799 - this style started out with thespook's style. Sadly, he never came around to update his style for deviantArt v6.\r\n- http://boffinbrain.deviantart.com/ - I used his toolbar icons. I hope he'll make icons for all of the new v6 icons aswell\r\n- http://asmodiel.deviantart.com/ - I used some of his emoticons\r\n\r\nThis is a complete redesign of deviantart v6. All pages should be covered - at least all that I use and have seen.\r\n\r\nI do however also use deviantTIDY:\r\n\r\nhttp://boffinbrain.deviantart.com/art/deviantTIDY-45622809\r\n\r\nI encourage everyone to use this as style or extension as it makes deviantart better.\r\n\r\nstyle style 906 is also a nice addition to this style.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTICE THAT THIS STYLE IS SEVERAL SIZES TOO BIG FOR USERSTYLES.ORG AND I DO NOT LIKE\r\nLINKING TO PICTURES ON SOME WEBSPACE. TO INSTALL IT YOU HAVE TO GRAB THE .CSS FROM HERE:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.filesavr.com/devartv6smokinorange\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some full-size screenshots:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.filesavr.com/screenshot1\r\nhttp://www.filesavr.com/screenshot2\r\nhttp://www.filesavr.com/screenshot3\r\n\r\nUPDATES:\r\n\r\n9/12: seems like I forgot the message center and notices section .. probably because no one ever sent me a message on deviantart :P it's all fixed now. Please grab the new .css \r\n9/13: fixed all settings/profile pages, folder view gallery pages. Many other smaller fixes. As always, grab the new css pls.",
