{"id":20567,"info":{"name":"imagevenue.com - Remove useless overlays","description":"Everytime i open an image hosted at imagevenue.com the image is overlayed with an information that i need to accept the TOS. Maybe it’s a bug, or the fact, that i do not save any cookies. Whatever it is, it is annoying, so i decided to create an user style, that removes the overlay.\r\n\r\nAnother useless overlay is the one showing an ad from   s t r e a m m a t e .  c o m   that is annoying, too.\r\n\r\nThis user style removes them both.\r\n\r\nEdit 2010-02-22: The new donate for Haiti overlay got removed now, too. (I guess that i see it all the time is because i’m ot accepting cookies from ImageVenue)","format":"uso","category":"imagevenue","updatedAt":"2010-02-22T15:52:03.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":14724,"name":"Dirk_","paypalEmail":"webmaster@jana-pallaske.net"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":373,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"imagevenue.com\") {\r\n\r\ndiv#overlaybg, div#ajax_load_indicator,\r\ndiv[id*=\"dtemplate13\"],\r\ndiv[id*=\"inter\"]\r\n {\r\n  visibility: hidden !important;\r\n  display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}}
