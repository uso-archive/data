{"id":2694,"info":{"name":"CBC Headline fix Linux","description":"In Linux, H2 on the CBC homepage defaults to the Serif font. Serif is larger than Times New Roman (which is the intended font) and so the headlines on the homepage can overrun and look ugly. This style spells out \"Times New Roman\" as the font to use for H2 instead of just \"Times\" and the headlines look correct.\r\n\r\nNote that you need to download msttcorefonts package or get the Times New Roman font from somewhere for this to benefit you.","format":"uso","category":"cbc","updatedAt":"2007-06-23T13:03:21.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":3105,"name":"voyager6868","paypalEmail":"mjnichol@alumni.uwaterloo.ca"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":315,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"2694_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document domain(cbc.ca) {\r\n#secB h2 {\r\n\theight: 42px !important;\r\n\tpadding: 9px 5px 7px !important;\r\n\tmargin: 0 !important;\r\n\tfont: bold 21px Times New Roman, serif !important;\r\n\tborder-bottom: 1px solid #666 !important;\r\n\tline-height: 21px !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}}
