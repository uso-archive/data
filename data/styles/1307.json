{"id":1307,"info":{"name":"GMail New \"Forward All\" Feature Hilite","description":"Gmail just added something I've wanted for a long time - the ability to forward all messages in a conversation at once.  Hooray!  Perhaps due to my over-exhuberance (GOD I love GMail!),  I've made that \"far right menu option\" stand out in bold red.  I believe the div[class=\"ar'} would apply to all items in that list, but I just wanted \"Forward All\" to stand out.\r\n\r\nYou can obviously change the font size/color (MOST of you will!  Ha ha!) below; this is just my preference.","format":"uso","category":"google","updatedAt":"2006-11-10T10:04:27.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":15,"name":"Paulfox","paypalEmail":"paulbrit@gmail.com"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1003,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"1307_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n/*Coded by Paulfox Nov 10th 2006 10AM Ver 1.1*/\r\n@-moz-document domain(mail.google.com) {[id=\"fthd\"] {color:red!important; font-size:14pt!important; font-weight:bold!important}}"}}
