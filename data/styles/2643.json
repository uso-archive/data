This feature was already available from the list of tags at the end of the article.\r\n\r\nThe automatic links are confusing whenever there are \"real\" links on a page.\r\n\r\nThis style fixes the problem by coloring the automatic links green (to somewhat match the kotaku theme) rather than the standard red.",
