    "description": "Simply put: it removes the Explore tab (mainstream media/controversies) and \"trending\" now on the right hand side.\r\n\r\nIf you want to block out all the political noise, here you go. If something BIG was *actually* going on, someone you follow is going to engage. You'll see it.\r\n\r\n<small>I think the trending hashtags that make it to trending are unintentionally getting bigger from the replies criticising such tags. It's probably how a trending tag correlating to a recent event can stay on 1K tweets for hours on end for an entire country. I still find it suspiciously selective either way.</small>",
