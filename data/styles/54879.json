{"id":54879,"info":{"name":"Turntable.fm - Smallify your Buttons!","description":"Ever click the wrong button because it popped up, last second, in the way?  Ever try to access the buttons for one user who's standing behind another user?  The buttons on turntable.fm are too large!  This script does not fix how fidgety they are but it does make it easier to get to the button you want.  The button text may be difficult to read if you are old, still using a 15\" monitor, or a combination of the two, but this script does make it easier to click specific buttons.\r\n\r\nMy other styles (related):\r\nstyle 54940\r\nstyle 54942\r\n\r\nStyle created by my friend, user 54307:\r\nstyle 49559\r\n\r\nI also made a few color changes.  These are a matter of personal preference.  Feel free to remove the .blue & .gold class styles if you don't like my new colors.\r\n\r\nI use this along with style 49559 for maximum benefit.","format":"uso","category":"turntable","updatedAt":"2011-10-11T11:35:25.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":120228,"name":"dantronix"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":275,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"54879_after.jpeg","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"turntable.fm\") {\r\n\r\n.tooltip_btn {\r\n  font-size:0.55em !important;\r\n  padding: 1px !important;\r\n  width: 75px !important;\r\n  margin-left: 20px !important;\r\n  margin-top: 1px !important;\r\n  word-wrap: normal !important;\r\n}\r\n.blue {\r\n  background-color: #333 !important;\r\n}\r\n.gold {\r\n  background-color: #3333BB !important;\r\n}\r\n.gold:hover {\r\n  background-color: #111188 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}}
