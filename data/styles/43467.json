    "description": "For Firefox 4+ and latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds.\r\n\r\nThis delays the connecting, waiting, loading status display messages from showing instantly at bottom of screen and gives it a min-width, so the Connection Status Display popup flickering won't be so noticeable and annoying. Due to (bug 628654 -Show connecting / waiting / loading status messages in small overlay on top of content at bottom of screen)\r\n\r\nTested on Firefox 4+ and up to the latest Firefox Beta, Aurora, Nightly builds.\r\n\r\nCredit for code goes to:\r\n\r\nuser 15980\r\n\r\nUser Z!p on: http://forums.mozillazine.org/\r\n\r\nTo customize or fix Firefox Beta, Aurora, and Nightly builds, you can also have a look at my other styles: user 61655",
    "additionalInfo": "Updated 02-03-2011\r\nNow compatible with the most recent Firefox 4b12pre Hourly and Nightly build. Had to Revert the delay code back to the original code by Tss.\r\n\r\nUpdated 02-01-2011\r\nChanged Status Display fixed width to a min-width like Google Chrome (bug 629898 - Set min-width on statuspanel for less jitter) and improved the delay css code as Tss suggested. Also, changed the userstyle name.",
