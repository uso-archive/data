    "additionalInfo": "Again, the purpose of this userstyle is to have Colored Weekeds WITH Gray Weekdays. The typical color-scheme allows colored weekends with WHITE weekdays, the \"accessibility\" color scheme allows Dark-Gray weekends with light-gray weekdays... this merges the \"best\" of both. (\"Best\" that is, if you like dimmed down weekdays and visually appealing accents for the weekends!)\r\n\r\nAlso, this scheme does not allow one to customize the color of weekends in the standard color-scheme, but it does allow you to (by editing the code) use the color of your choice for weekends in the accessibility scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords: Thunderbird, TB, Lightning, Calendar, views, colors, weekends, customize, etc...",
