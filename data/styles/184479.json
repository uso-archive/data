    "description": "Tired of scrolling around to see which game the simul host is looking at? The current game is placed right atop the other games. Also semi-responsive (adapts to the size of the screen, sort of)! The only side effect I've noticed is that completed simuls have a large blank space where the current game board is supposed to go. I'm not sure if I can fix that.",
