Once you've installed this style it's recommended that you open your preferences and play around with your default font size until you have it at a size that is comfortable for you.\r\n\r\nDepending on the size that you choose, some websites (especially badly coded ones) could break when this style is active.\r\n\r\nSuggestions for improvement are very welcome.","format":"uso","category":"global","updatedAt":"2010-03-19T08:34:35.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":18478,"name":"ingolemo"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1404,"weekly":1}},"screenshots":{"main":"13585_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":2}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n* {\r\n font-size:inherit !important;\r\n line-height:inherit !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nhtml {\r\n font-size:medium !important;\r\n line-height:1.4 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nh1 {font-size:xx-large !important;}\r\nh2 {font-size:x-large !important;}\r\nh3 {font-size:large !important;}\r\nh4 {font-size:medium !important;}"}}
