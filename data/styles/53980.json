If you already had this script installed, you might need to erase your cache.\r\nOctober 1, 2011 - Facebook changed some things on the site rendering \"Facepalm\" completely invisible. This has been fixed.\r\nOctober 7, 2011 - Facebook changed some things on the site rendering \"Facepalm\" completely invisible.
