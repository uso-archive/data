It shouldn't become broken anymore, unless Facebook makes major site changes.\r\nMay 29, 2012 - Facebook changed some things again, and the logo had to be tweaked a little.\r\nNovember 28, 2011 - Facepalm didn't look quite right compared to the screenshot. I fixed this, and it looks better. If you already had this script installed, you might need to erase your cache.\r\nOctober 1, 2011 - Facebook changed some things on the site rendering \"Facepalm\" completely invisible. This has been fixed.\r\nOctober 7, 2011 - Facebook changed some things on the site rendering \"Facepalm\" completely invisible. This has been fixed.\r\nOctober 7, 2011 - Changed Data URI to a URL.\r\nOctober 26, 2011 - Facebook changed some things on the site rendering \"Facepalm\" completely invisible. This has been fixed.",
