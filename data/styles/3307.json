    "description": "MySpace Home Cleanz0rz is an effective way to clean up your mySpace Home. It is very easely customizable, as you will see in the code. Also, it does a neat little thing to the InfoBox (that thingwith your profile views in it). I created this userstyle because I wasn't happy with any of the other MySpace Home ones available. I guess no one will ever be happy with any preset for his or her MySpace Home, that's why I made sure this one is easely editable.\r\n\r\nOh, and for the heck of it, check out my profile!\r\nhttp://www.myspace.com/r0bsp03l\r\n\r\nHere is a link to a high resolution screenshot:\r\nhttp://img183.imageshack.us/img183/3013/screenafterbqa1.png\r\n\r\n[Update #1]\r\nAdded more switchable sections.\r\nMySpace Tom's announcements should now be showed by default\r\nHide \"powered by Google\"\r\n\r\n[Update #2]\r\nAdded a switch for the Profile Options (Classic/New).\r\nRehid \"powered by Google\" and the search bar.\r\nResized the big blue header so it looks better.\r\n> @EdenResident, I couldn't find the \"Your Network\" box you are mentioning, could you please provide a screenshot? I'll be glad to get rid of it for you :)\r\n\r\n[Update #3]\r\nHid Friend Updates by default. You can display them again by uncommenting the correct line of code as described.\r\n> @yestergray, I can't find that box, maybe MySpace has removed it by now :)",
