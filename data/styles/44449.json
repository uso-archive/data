    "description": "Based a lot on The Aeroboy Chrome extension (http://goo.gl/1fBKP), these scrollbars are a slight refinement. Choose between his and mine, I'm not sure how much better or worse mine are! WEBKIT BROWSERS ONLY (Chromium, Safari, ect. - NOT Firefox).\r\n\r\nNEW - Mozilla version: style 46044.\r\n\r\nDifferences to Aeroboy's extension:\r\n - Transparency on all scrollbars except the far outer ones.\r\n - Change of colour on hover and mouse down.\r\n - Thinner.\r\n - Possible other things I have forgotten.\r\n\r\nScreenshot notes:\r\n - Them two scrollbars in \"after\" really are the same colour, it's an optical illusion! Even I (who wrote the code) had to check this in Paint.\r\n - The scrollbar in \"before\" is from an XP theme I have downloaded (i.e. the system default).\r\n - The screenshots are from this page (the edit page), with style 44215 activated.",
    "additionalInfo": "Release history:\r\n1.0: What it started as.\r\n1.1: \"Overlays\" scrollbar onto background (rather than creating a white bar.\r\nFixed (sort of) problem with pages that do not have a background or body scrollbar. System scrollbar used as body scrollbar in these cases.\r\n1.1.1: Added option for overlaying, as this caused problems with smooth mouse wheel and arrow key scrolling with Chromium Wheel and Smooth Scroll, and stopped all wheel/key scrolling on other sites. Option 2 must be the same as option 1 (otherwise it doesn't work or is rubbish).\r\n1.2: Reverted to white track, made minor, unnoticeable tweak.\r\n1.2.1: Slight differences in code.",
