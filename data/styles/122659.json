    "description": "Fixes a usability issue with Twitter's search suggestions by putting dynamically loaded suggestions at the bottom of the list, rather than the top.",
    "additionalInfo": "When using the search box on Twitter, topic suggestions dynamically appear at the top of the box after a second or two, pushing account and saved searches down. Attempting to click an account or saved search suggestion often results in accidentally clicking a topic suggestion instead, due to the delay in them appearing.\r\n\r\nThis style forces the topic suggestions to always be at the bottom of the list, meaning they no longer change the location of the other suggestions when they load in.",
