    "additionalInfo": "Made very quickly but doesn't appear to have bugs.\r\n\r\nToday, its \"no like animation\" behavior looks identical to XKit's but my code should only apply to April Fools (was included to keep you from needing XKit for that).\r\n\r\nAside from that behavior, it also hides the button on the right edge of the screen and all frames around avatars. Everything else is visible, because you have to get that yourself to see it at all.",
