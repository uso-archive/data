    "description": "A Darkened (gray/black) enhanced, annoyance-free, J.A.D. experience. For those who just want to watch anime and not have to sift through all the clutter. Be aware I assume you use adblock plus, no sense in doing their work too -- if not get it!",
    "additionalInfo": "Version 1 - Initial Release: May 31, 2015 Last Day of Month\r\n\r\n- Was not going to release it because i thought it was dumb but I got bored and...\r\n- Widened for Desktops - Especially those that utilize HD (1080i) screens\r\n- Almost all clutter removed, except the donation button, which is neatly placed in the upper-right corner (and blended with the background)\r\n- Background and some other graphics simplified to fit darker theme\r\n- PLAYER PAGE (most important) has:\r\n  - enlarged viewing box\r\n  - ads and 'click to continue' crap removed\r\n  - next episode button enlarged and placed in plain sight, esp good for touchscreens\r\n  - I preselected the most reliable player and hid the rest, thats because I have had 0% downtime  or slowtime on this preselected player, if this ever changes, I'll post and update... but I doubt it (been a year or two now)\r\n- PLEASE NOTE, the 'full list' page was a major pain in the neck and takes advantage of some EXPERIMENTAL mozilla css features, it wont work on opera or chrome (or shouldn't), if you have a patch, upload it  to me i'll be happy to fix it\r\n- Public Domain! need I say more...\r\n \r\n* I actually did put a bit of time into getting this one right, I am curious to see if it works on anyone elses machine since I haven't had the time to test it... read the CSS comments for even more information text... *",
