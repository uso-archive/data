    "description": "On DSmeet's forums, a box containing forum rules is often displayed on top of forum pages. Seeing as how I'm a moderator and I don't need to be reminded of the rules all the time, I made this style to remove the box on the default revolution skin. Please, however, obey the rules and don't use this style as an excuse to be a troublemaker.",
