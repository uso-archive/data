{"id":668,"info":{"name":"DSmeet.com Forums | Remove forum rules box","description":"On DSmeet's forums, a box containing forum rules is often displayed on top of forum pages. Seeing as how I'm a moderator and I don't need to be reminded of the rules all the time, I made this style to remove the box on the default revolution skin. Please, however, obey the rules and don't use this style as an excuse to be a troublemaker.","format":"uso","category":"dsmeet","updatedAt":"2006-07-20T15:41:20.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":517,"name":"Sakurina"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":147,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"668-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"/* DSmeet Forums - Remove forum rules */\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"forums.dsmeet.com\") {\r\n\r\n.forum_rules {\r\ndisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n}"}}
