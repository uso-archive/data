    "description": "If you're like me, you cannot stand the default font family and sizes displayed on the website or the size / font of the buttons and form fields. To me, they're just too large and I prefer a smaller (though still visible) more \"organized\" look. I was quite annoyed when they enlarged all the drop-down menu's, text field's and button's fonts.\r\n\r\nThis changes the entire site's (including petpages, user lookups, guilds, shops, etc.) to Tahoma 8pt.\r\nIt can easily be turned on/off, but since this just edits font, it shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nClick and drag the screenshots to your address bar for a full view.\r\n\r\nIf there's anything I've missed or you feel should be added, let me know. ^^",
