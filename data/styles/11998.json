    "description": "Last fm (lastFM) user navigation menus will be transparent.\r\n\r\nThis style improves page visibility, allowing you to see all the web content behind the transparency.\r\n\r\n* Thanks to user 1386 for the style 10306, upon which I got the idea for this style!\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n+ User Name (Username) selection menus (Home, Profile, Recommended, Library, Events, Settings) will be transparent.\r\n+ Menus will become more opaque when they are hovered over with the mouse cursor\r\n+ You will be able to see images and text behind the header menu (see thru) until hovered over\r\n\r\nWorks on both Firefox 2 and Firefox 3\r\nAlso works with the Painted Black built-in LastFM Style\r\n\r\nIntegrates with the following Styles:\r\nStyle 11529\r\nStyle 11902\r\n\r\nLast.FM nav menus are also known as badger dropdown lists, and consist of UL (unordered list) code segments\r\nEdit the Transparency (-moz-opacity) to your liking.  Remember, the closer to 0 you get, the more invisible translucent the menu will be, the closer to 1 you get, the more opaque!   1 is 100% opaque, and web content will not show through, 0 is 0% opaque, and will appear as if the menu is hidden!\r\nBenOnUserstyles\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.1:\r\n+ Added a new menu (global song / user options menu).  This menu appears near song tracks and looks like a small cog gear.  It allows you to view certain options such as view song, view album, listen to song...\r\n+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.",
