{"id":134868,"info":{"name":"Gmail Simple Default Rebirth Theme","description":"Description:\r\n\r\nIt's been a couple of years since my first stylish theme with almost 2000 installs. These days I've toned back to using bare minimal design and not trying to tweak the hell out of stylish as thing eventually break the more you use different plugins.
