    "description": "A recent release of Greenhopper to the Atlassian OnDemand platform has made some parts of the system significantly harder to use, so this small style update makes only two changes:\r\n- Set the issue detail panel to 700px instead of the newly hardcoded 400px in the new UI\r\n- Remove the padding between properties in the issue detail panel",
    "additionalInfo": "This style is only expected to be of any use for a short time while the Greenhopper team address the display/usability issues recently introduced (as of May 20th 2013).\r\n\r\nNote, this is my own opinion of usability, based on having typically complex issues in greenhopper and a big screen - this hardcoded width will not work well on smaller screens.\r\n\r\nAlso note: The greenhopper team, has an open issue for making the detail panel size configurable: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/GHS-7874",
