    "description": "Bookmark folders shown without icons in BLUE,  and any bookmark not  in a folder would be considered  special and would be shown without icons  in RED.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to use minimum real estate for  Bookmarks Toolbar,  so folders are used almost exclusively, and try to keep the folder names to 1-4  characters.  I know what my folders are so they don't need long names.\r\n\r\nThe Firefox 4.0 and up version can be found at style 46947 (46947)",
    "additionalInfo": "Modifications:\r\nSet up to run on Vista with this line \r\n   margin: -5px 0 0 0 !important; \r\nIf running on Windows 2000 the rows would overlap try \r\n   margin:  0   0 0 0 !important; \r\nAdjustments may be required depending depending on font sizes and Operating System.\r\nIf min- & max-height:18px is too high try 11px same as font-size + 1px, make sure there is 1 pixel spacing below character hangers.\r\n\r\nMost of  my keyword shortcuts and Firefox references are in a personal toolbar  in my \"[http://dmcritchie.mvps.org/firefox/lessons/intro/k.html K]\" folder and  described on my [http://dmcritchie.mvps.org/firefox/kws.htm Firefox Keyword Shortcuts] (KWS), also on my bookmarks toolbar are a few  bookmarklets (\"gg:fix\", \"Pz\", \"Sp\") that I keep directly on the personal bookmarks toolbar, a write-up can be seen in my [http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/lessons/intro/fx4_intro.htm#kws Firefox Intro] materials.\r\n\r\nThis is one of several styles to minimize size of toolbars.  To save more toolbar space see styles listed by my name at the top of the page (user 12592).  About half of my styles are involved with making toolbars more compact AND easier to view.  Namely these styles:  style 9091 (9091), style 13115 (13115), style 9350 (9350, also see 18864, 9349), style 13211 (13211), style 9023 (9023), style 9043 (9043) and style 9514 (9514).\r\n\r\nFor best viewing of style before/after images in their actual sizes use style 12373 (12373), you should be seeing the after picture about 2/3 height of original, and approx 1/2 the width of the original.   The after picture is a lot smaller after removal of folders and slight lowering of the font-size.   In other words if you are already using very short folder names on your Bookmarks Toolbar  you will be able to see twice as many folders if you don't show the folder icons.\r\n\r\nThe bookmark separators cause bookmarks in each group to be sorted separately so on the bookmarks toolbar I can see a group of bookmarks in the midst of folders and the will remain undisturbed when sorting bookmarks.\r\n\r\nUpdates, since 2008-07-26\r\n2008-10-07 Changed  to suggested font-size 10px rather than default and expecting user to modify.",
