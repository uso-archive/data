    "description": "This Style uses Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color definition for the background color of the\r\nBrowsing Selected Tab and Non-selected Tabs.  You can experiment & change these 2 colors to your\r\npreference.  This Style can be used in combination with style 4329 .\r\n::\r\nThis Style was tested on Firefox 2.0 using its default theme \"Firefox (default) 2.0\".\r\nCode starting point was style 2019 .\r\n::\r\nSOME DETAILS:\r\n::\r\nFirefox 2.0's default theme \"Firefox (default) 2.0\", automatically grades\r\nthe color vertically.  The color that you set in the code seems to be the color at the very bottom of the tab.\r\n::\r\nThis Style does not have code related to hovering/mousing-over (nor related to the close-out button other\r\nthan the background surrounding it).  Note that with Firefox's default theme, hovering over a tab results in:\r\n   - For the Selected Tab, all stays the same.\r\n   - For a Non-selected Tab, all color becomes lighter.  (Its close-out button stays the same gray out\r\nuntil directly hovered over.)\r\n::\r\nGeneral Note:  For people who prefer setting colors as RGB, the existing code for any color in any Style\r\ncan be modified by using the format shown in this Style's code.\r\n::\r\n::\r\nNOTE: THE SCREENSHOTS CAN BE ENLARGED BY RIGHT-CLICKING EACH > View Image.",
