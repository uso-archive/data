    "additionalInfo": "Applies a right-to-left layout to the address bar in order to move flip identity box and reload button the way Firefox developers intended it. Also moves the address back to the left for the overall look to feel normal.\r\n\r\nRelevant: style 65628\r\n\r\nThe style is experimental, because there are some side effects to this usage:\r\n<ul><li>Autocomplete items are right-to-left too (haven't found a workaround to switch them back yet)</li>\r\n<li>If the URL has a forward-slash at the end, it will appear at the right instead (caused by RTL as a whole?)</li></ul>\r\n\r\nIf the bugs get ironed out, though, it has a potential of being cleaner, more future-proof and even prettier than my other styles style 121010 and style 92775 because Firefox developers deal with the RTL CSS, not me :P",
