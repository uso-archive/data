    "additionalInfo": "<b>Prerequisites</b>\r\n<a href=https://gospik.com</a>Gospik</a>\r\nA Google account to sign in with\r\n\r\n<b>Information</b>\r\nGospik is a rather neat addon for people who like to be social butterflies and discuss things. Piggybacking off of Google search results, its aim is to make discussion a part of search by letting you annotate search results with your commentary and opinions, and read what others had contributed.\r\n\r\nThere are some faux pas I believe this addon commits; While the Gospik logo acts as a dimmer switch to draw your attention more to the big shiny textarea and post button, does their logo <i>really</i> need to be there? Also, I find it a dumb feature when Google doesn't even do that for their search box.\r\n\r\nWhy de-emphasize the counter and show the very search term you typed in above it? Strange design decisions that don't really make sense in my mind, so I've committed these changes to fix what I thought was broken in their addon.\r\n\r\n<b>Updates</b>\r\n<i>01/26/16</i> Left comments counter in centre instead of the very left, and modified the input box and button to look like the ones from YouTube.\r\n\r\n<b>Future plans</b>\r\nIf somebody cares about the dimmer feature, I'll make a variant that doesn't remove the logo, rather resizes the image and put a lightbulb image in its place.",
