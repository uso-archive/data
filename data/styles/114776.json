    "description": "Retain the Bookmark Star on toolbar that allows you to see if current url is bookmarked, and allows you to bookmark the current page, or to remove the bookmark from within Bookmark edit dialog.  This style removes/hides the Version 29 change which included \"Show Bookmarks\" menu attached to the Bookmark Star.\r\n\r\nSecondary feature of this style is to also remove the annoying animation when bookmarking via the star occurs, which was also added in Fx29 or later.\r\n\r\nThe tooltip indicates on the part being removed that it is equivalent to Ctrl+Shift+T, which is incorrect it is in fact equivalent to Alt+B (Windows) Bookmarks menu, from which you could invoke the more complete Show Bookmarks (Ctrl+Shift+T).",
    "additionalInfo": "You may have to restart Firefox for the style to be implemented.  During testing, I could do a Preview and see changes, but when I did a Save the changes disappeared. So suggest restarting Firefox before determining whether it works for your or not.\r\n\r\nIf you want to remove the Pocket icon near end of the location bar that was added in Version 34, you can remove that in about:config with about:config   browser.preferences.inContent     False \r\n\r\nMore fixes for Annoyances introduced by Firefox version updates can be found in my <a href=\"http://dmcritchie.mvps.org/firefox/firefox-problems.htm#fx29\">Firefox Problems &amp; Issues (Notes)</a>\r\n\r\nYou can find other styles that I have written linked on this page under my name on this page.\r\n\r\nSeveral Extensions and Styes that I use can be found on my MozillaZine user page, <a href=\"http://kb.mozillazine.org/User:Dmcritchie\">User:Dmcritchie - MozillaZine Knowledge Base</a>\r\n\r\nUpdates to CSS since 2015-06-05: none",
