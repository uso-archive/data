    "description": "You know who before you click an image that is in a text post its smaller?\r\nWell recently I noticed that tumblr seemed to make it even smaller and I'm just not down with this.  So I created this hack so you could make it larger.  Meh its pretty simple its just max width.",
    "additionalInfo": "if you want them to be a little smaller or a little bigger just change the 300 to your desired pixel number.\r\n\r\nit would probably be better for you if you make your max-width not extend 500 because it won't fit in the dash posts",
