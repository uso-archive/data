Tweak as you wish.\r\n\r\nI doubt I will do any more tweaking to this (other than fixing what DE breaks), it looks good enough for me. \r\nFeel free to edit as long as you give credit.","format":"uso","category":"warframe","updatedAt":"2017-03-04T09:05:05.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":278761,"name":"Shifted"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":188,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"124782_after.jpeg","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"forums.warframe.com\") {\r\nbody.ipsApp {\r\n    background: #060606 url(http://content.invisioncic.com/Mwarframe/pages_media/forums_background.jpg) no-repeat fixed center top; }\r\n}"}}
