    "description": "For people who <i>really</i> want to see ranks in chat\r\n\r\n<b>Requires <a href=http://dubx.net>DubX</a>!</b>",
    "additionalInfo": "<b>Introduction</b>\r\nThis is intended for DubX users, to be used with Better Chat. Used alone, it'll look a little funny, and appear just for you.\r\n\r\nThis was created mostly for fun, but people who want to make it a serious part of their DubTrack theme can use it to do so. Chat ranks are aligned to the right, in pseudochildren, centered with the user avatar.\r\n\r\n<b>Bugs</b>\r\nDue to how DubX handles creator rank (rather, how it <i>doesn't</i>), all creators are also co-owners. This is only a minor inconvenience for theme maintainers, as you can allow specific users by default; Until that is fixed, replace .isCreator in line 49 (or about that) with the ID number of the room creator, or stuff that under user-specific settings.\r\n\r\n<b>GitHub release</b>\r\nIf you want the code straight away for addition into your community theme, then <a href=https://hebgbs.github.io/bcranks.css>get it here.</a> It looks as intended when used with <a href-https://hebgbs.github.io/betterchat.css>Better Chat</a>, but can also be used alone.",
