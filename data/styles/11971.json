    "description": "This changes the font colors in the Download dialog, and in the Add-ons dialog.\r\nI made this out of necessity, because I absolutely love the Together with Foxkeh extension.\r\n(if you don't know, it puts little Foxkeh images throughout Firefox.)\r\n\r\nBut, for some reason, when I use it, the fonts for selected items in the Download and Add-ons dialogs are white, and therefore, invisible against the background, unless I use a dark theme.\r\nIn other words, I couldn't read the words for anything selected in those 2 dialogs, as you can see in the before picture below.\r\n\r\nBut, thanks to the wonders of Stylish (which I just discovered today, about a few hours ago.) it can be fixed!\r\n\r\nAnd, since I didn't see any thing on user styles that also did this, I decided to post it.\r\n\r\nJust change the color: item to whatever you want (currently orange, to make it stand out in the after picture.)\r\nYou can also change the font of unselected items by removing the comments surrounding color under the items with [selected=\"false\"](currently set to orange, and commented out)\r\nYou may also remove the comments around the background-color items to change the background color (currrently set to blue, and commented out.)",
