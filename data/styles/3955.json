    "description": "This is my \"work in progress\" toward coloring the GMail buttons now their site has changed.\r\nFOR NOW, all the buttons are green - I wanted black, but that screwed up the new Contacts Page Buttons.  I'm working on delineating the individual buttons but it's seemingly rather difficult and I won't have any more time tonight.  Rather a pain, and I've been on it 3 hours already.\r\n\r\nMy former script here\r\nhttp://userstyles.org/styles/291\r\n\r\nwas very popular, but it's not working as of 10/29/07 due to a site change.  GOOD News . . . GMail is much improved, bigger mailbox size, and larger contact photos and contact list controls.  Very cool!",
