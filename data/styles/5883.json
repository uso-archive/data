{"id":5883,"info":{"name":"Amazon Anywhere","description":"I got tired of Amazon's bloat - it takes forever to load, and there is just too much stuff on the screen. I tried to reduce the clutter ( style 4328 ), but that doesn't help the load time.\r\n\r\nThen I discovered Amazon has a mobile site (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw), which is virtually text-only (small icons and cover pics), and lightning-quick. Works well in a sidebar, too.\r\n\r\nI felt that it could use space a little more efficiently though. And removed a couple of categories I'm never going to use.","format":"uso","category":"amazon","updatedAt":"2009-11-18T18:40:36.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":5140,"name":"timepiece","paypalEmail":"debmorrissey@gmail.com"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":793,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"5883-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw\") {\r\n\r\n/* * { max-width: 210px!important; } for sidebar/gadget use - delete otherwise */\r\nBODY { font-size: small; }\r\n\r\nHR, INPUT + BR, A + A + A + A + BR,  FONT[size=\"-1\"], \r\nIMG[alt=\"Auto\"], IMG[alt=\"Photo \"], IMG[alt=\"Sporting Goods \"], IMG[alt=\"Wireless \"], IMG[alt=\"ETC \"], IMG[alt=\"Magazines \"] { \r\n    display: none; } /* remove unnecessary elements, couple of \"stores\" */\r\n\r\nA > IMG { width: 22px!important; height: 22px!important; }\r\n\r\nLEFT > P:first-child { margin: -10px 0 0 0; } /* move logo up */\r\n}"}}
