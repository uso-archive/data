    "description": "Minimizes the \"What's New\" blog section of the Zillow Rentals (RentJuice) Dashboard...it does not remove it, but it does optimize the space to only show that there is something new rather than wasting space to display the entire content of a blog post.\r\n\r\nNote* - This style was created before RentJuice was sold to Zillow so the name of the style will not change to ensure that the url is always the same.",
    "additionalInfo": "Version: 2.0.0\r\nReleased: April 2nd, 2013\r\n\r\n- Change Log -\r\n2.0.0 - April 2nd, 2013 - Zillow decided to break the style completely so I rewrote it to not only hide the blog post data but this time I condensed the entire thing into one line saving even more space. (Zillow/RentJuice can't be relied on to do anything properly)\r\n1.1.0 - October 14th, 2012 - Bug Fix: compatibility issue after domain switch from rentjuice to rentals.zillow.com\r\n1.0.0 - October 8th, 2012 - Initial Release",
