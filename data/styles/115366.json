    "additionalInfo": "==== TOP OF NOTES -- SCROLLING AREA - LIMITED VIEW =====\r\nThere is always so much wasted space on the Firefox toolbars, and can't keep up with trying to reduce damages as Mozilla continually makes changes up and down on empty space but never removes bloated space on toolbars.\r\n                    \r\nSuggested companion to reduce wasted space on Bookmarks toolbar is Style 101569 (101569), which removes all bookmark icons on the toolbar and identifies folders with blue text, and bookmarks used as buttons with Red text.  Bookmark icons elsewhere are not affected such as those within folders on the bookmarks toolbar, they are still shown.\r\n\r\n&nbsp; <b><i>(You must scroll down with inner ScrollBar to read all notes Below)</i></b>\r\n\r\nCheck other styles of mine, User 12592, along with their descriptions.  For now skip my other Location/Navigation bar  styles, keeping them up to date is a lost battle with no survivors.  Would love to modify this so that the url can be read by someone in back of room from a projected screen, as you can see there is certainly room for a larger font, and with a larger font the Navigation toolbar would still be bloated with both empty vertical and horizontal space.\r\n\r\n<b>Recommended companion styles</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Style 46947 (46947)</li>\r\n<li>Style 114776 (114776)</li>\r\n<li>Style 115371 (115371)</li>\r\n<li>Style 9350 (9350)</li>\r\n<li>Style 115366 (115366), this style.</li>\r\n<li>Style 30551 (30551)</li>\r\n<li>Style 54 (54), not shown but you need scrollbar.</li>\r\n<li>Style 52 (52), not shown but you need scroolbar.</li> \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n==== BOTTOM OF NOTES -- SCROLLING AREA - LIMITED VIEW =====",
