    "name": "Resize Images to Maximum Size when Mouse Hovers",
    "description": "Hover your mouse over an image, and it will display in its full size.  This only works for images that have been resized in code (example: The preview images of Styles on UserStyles)\r\n\r\n** Thanks goes to user 16 for the Image Resize idea, which is used in the style 127.  I made the code work on Width and Height as well, not just Max-width and Max-Height!!\r\n\r\nTry it out!\r\nOnce you install the Style, head over to the page: Style 7875 and give it a try... Cool hey?\r\n\r\nFunctions:\r\n- When you hover your mouse over an image that has been resized, it will display normally.\r\n\r\nApplies to:\r\n- Any image that has been resized by code\r\n- max-width, preventing a full-width image\r\n- max-height, preventing a full-height image\r\n+ Just hover your mouse cursor over the image, and it will appear in it's original state (100% size, as if you were to save it to your disk.)\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n- Works on Firefox 2\r\n- Works on Firefox 3\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n+ This style works PERFECTLY on Userstyles.org for the Image Previews of the Styles!\r\n+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes!  It has worked perfectly on each.\r\n\r\nExtension Compatability:\r\n** For those of you using the Firefox Extension \"Image Zoom\" please comment or remove the following lines in the code:  \r\n  height: auto !important;\r\n  width: auto !important;\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.4:\r\n+ Code Cleanup, making it function better\r\n+ Added Animated After Image - Use Firefox 3 to view the animation.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.3:\r\n+ Added support for Chrome:// (web pages inside Firefox's configuration) - now works on Extensions such as Brief.\r\n+ Added support for FTP sites.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.2:\r\n+ Added support for Local Files (html files located on local computer hard drive)\r\n\r\n1.0.0.1:\r\n+ Fixed Bug where images that Firefox resized were reacting to the hover sizing.\r\n+ Thanks goes Entirely to user User 347 for reporting the problem, AND producing a fix.  (This update fix was all myf's code)\r\nI thank you for the code, myf, and continual support of my styles.",
