    "description": "⧸ Style for <a href=\"http://www.mycandylove.com/\">www.mycandylove.com</a> ⧸\r\n<br><small>It's not an exact replica, but the differences should get smaller the longer I work on it. <br><br>\r\n<sup>* Case-sensitive.<br>** [In beta stage, not sure how well it will work in the long-run.] For browsers that support Linear-Gradients. If not, the solid card color will act as a fallback. (also, here's a good <a href=\"http://www.cssmatic.com/gradient-generator\">Gradient Generator</a> to make things easier.)<br>*** Unfortunately, there's a character limit on the \"free-form\" text option. There's a way to get around this, but I don't know how well it works for different browsers. If you inspect the text box and change the \"maxlength\" number to a larger one (90 should be plenty), then you can bypass the max character limit for that single install/update (<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/yaR4LM9.gif\">gif example</a>).",
