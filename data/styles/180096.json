    "description": "I made this thing years ago after tumblr removed blockquotes, and never really thought to post it. But a friend wanted it, so I figured I should make it available to everyone.\r\n\r\nQuick summary of what this does:\r\n- Indicates new additions to posts and grays out inactive blogs.\r\n- Rearranges posts to be more condensed.\r\n- Hides ads and suggestions\r\n\r\nI personally use this alongside a pretty basic XKit setup, but it seems to work the same with or without XKit.",
    "additionalInfo": "<b>What it does:</b>\r\n\r\nAround your dash:\r\n- Hides recommended posts, recommended blogs, tumblr radar, and ad boxes.\r\n\r\nInside posts:\r\n- Pushes authors' usernames to the right side and removes their avatar icons so that peoples' bad username/icon choices don't mess up your funky flow.\r\n- Deactivated blogs' usernames are greyed out instead of having the dumb effect where the \"deactivated\" text pops up when you hover over it. No more surprises.\r\n- If the person reblogging made a new addition, there is a pale blue bar in the margin beside their addition, so you know it's new.\r\n- Shrinks margins, meaning less empty space, making those 50-reply posts a little easier to scroll past.\r\n- The aforementioned margin thing has the weird side effect of making images a little bigger sometimes, which I actually think is pretty neat.\r\n\r\n<b>FAQ:</b>\r\n\r\nQ: Does this block ads?\r\nA: Nope, just hides the boxes containing them. If you want to fully block ads, I strongly suggest using uBlock Origin.\r\n\r\nQ: I want some features but not others!\r\nA: I'm not going to make toggles for everything, but I have left nice little comments above each bit of code. If you really hate something, try deleting the lines of code underneath the appropriate comment.\r\n\r\nQ: This broke something that shouldn't be broken!\r\nA: Send me a screenshot on tumblr! I'm babblingfishes there too.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I edit/repost this code for my own project?\r\nA: Yup! As long as you credit me.\r\n\r\n<b>Changelog:</b>\r\n2020-08-04:\r\nRemoved a new type of oversized video ad.\r\n2020-04-23:\r\nFixed an issue where the sidebar menu was hidden when managing your own posts.\r\n2020-03-30:\r\nTumblr's updated its theme! So I've hidden blog recs & radar on this one too. I might wait a bit for Tumblr to finalize its new theme before I go in and fix the rest of the tweaks.\r\n2020-02-12:\r\nIt's new!",
