    "description": "Cory Monteith's signature as a cursor for your Tumblr dashboard! (With bonus information on how to add this to your blog, instead!)(See Notes for update on July 16th)",
    "additionalInfo": "Updated on July 16th: I've gone back and forth on what to do with this in the wake of Cory's death and, in the end, my choice is to leave it up for anyone who would like to pay tribute to Cory. He was, and will continue to be, an inspiration to an entire generation of people worldwide through his role as Finn and his honesty in discussing his real life struggles, and I have nothing but the utmost respect for him even now. \r\nThank you, you loveable Canadian goofball, and rest in peace.\r\n\r\nTested on Firefox only. Please let me know on Tumblr (<a href=\"http://www.geekinthejeep.tumblr.com/\">GeekintheJeep</a>) with any possible alignment issues, questions, or requests!\r\n\r\n\r\nOr, if you'd rather add this to your blog instead of your dash, just place the code found here [<a href=\"http://pastebin.com/Hi70enxH\">x</a>] inside the body (search /head in your CSS and scroll down to the body section) portion of your blog's CSS.",
