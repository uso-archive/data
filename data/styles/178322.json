You may need to also change the color of the text to make things readable if you do.\r\n\r\n#669 is a nice faded blue color for this purpose.\r\n#779 is good, too.  * This is the one I'm currently using myself.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot was taken with this following one installed, too, with a smaller menu bar.\r\nhttps://userstyles.org/styles/130227/tatoeba-org-revert-to-smaller-menu-bar",
