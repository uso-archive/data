Some Stylish's or Firefox's bug.\r\nSometimes, somehow bookmark bar may become \"grey\" (bookmarks are not deleted!). Elements will be just hiding. You should open panel customization (see panel context menu) and try to drug bookmark bar elements.\r\nAlso you may try to: restart Firefox, use only English alphabet, turn on/off style.\r\nIn my case this bug disappeared. I don't know why.\r\n\r\n2. If you open tab with site into detached browser window, bookmarks (NOT bookmark bar!) may be hidden in new window bookmark bar.\r\n\r\nFix issue 2:\r\nYou can set one value on about:config page:\r\nbrowser.link.open_newwindow.restriction in 0\r\nThen restart Firefox.\r\nIt for opening all new detached WINDOWS (and popups) ONLY IN new TABS.","format":"uso","category":"browser","updatedAt":"2016-05-05T07:02:01.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":299700,"name":"haler"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":660,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"125737_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"/**\r\n *  You should open bookmark bar panel for working this CSS style!\r\n *  This CSS style works only with Stylish addon: https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/stylish/\r\n */\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul);\r\n\r\n#main-window:not([stylish-url^=\"about:\"]):not([stylish-url^=\"chrome:\"]) #PersonalToolbar\r\n{\r\n  display : none !important;\r\n}\r\n"}}
