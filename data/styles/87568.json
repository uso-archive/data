{"id":87568,"info":{"name":"Twitch no chat and full width","description":"Disables the Twitch.tv chat and applies full width in place of the chatbox.\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nYou may want to prevent yourself from spoilers concerning tv-shows and movies, also prevents you from seeing overall stupidity and anonimity around that place.\r\n\r\nWhy it's useful:\r\nEverytime you enter a twitch channel you're welcomed by the chat box, and then you have to click on it's settings and disable it. Remember that even before you click fullscreen-mode you might have already been spoiler'ed or struck by the stupidity.","format":"uso","category":"twitch","updatedAt":"2013-05-15T12:27:41.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":189235,"name":"bwillow"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":355,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"87568_after.jpeg","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"twitch.tv\") {\r\n#main_col {\r\n    margin-right: 0 !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#right_col {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}}
