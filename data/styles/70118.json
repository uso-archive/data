    "description": "Hides everything but the video and audio. With the logos and other text gone the browser can be put to full screen to give the illusion that your monitor is a window. \r\n\r\nTested on Firefox 43.0.x and Google Chrome 37.0.x.",
    "additionalInfo": "02.27.15: Making a couple needless edits to try to get a new screen shot because the curent one is black.\r\n11.03.14: This is still working on curent versions of Firefox and Chrome, I don't know why the automatic screen shot is black or how to get it to take another.\r\n09.16.14: Little bit of maintenance, a thing got though.\r\n06.04.14: Fixed again >.>; It's getting difficult for me to fix it, I'm no CSS expert. This time I just kept throwing elements at it till everything I didn't want to see was hidden again. Hopefully this version will last longer than the last.\r\n06.04.14: Oh for crap's sake they changed it again... I'll see if i can fix it again.\r\n05.20.14: Fixed again, no idea how long it was broke this time.\r\n10.07.13: At some point between when I made this and now they made a change to the site which resulted in the old version stopping the rain sound. Instead of figuring out how to continue using the old way I just remade it using a different method to hide stuff. Only tested in ff24.0.",
