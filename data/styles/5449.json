    "description": "For people who use the \"grab and drag\" extension, scrollwheels or scroll functions on touch pads, rather than the scrollbar, simply for people obsessed with screen 'real estate'...\r\n\r\nIt removes scrollbars from everywhere, including textboxes and the like.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple piece of code, but it makes sense to use it in stylish rather than in userchrome/usercontent.css because some people might want to turn this off and on sometimes.\r\n\r\nI've been using firefox without scrollbars for months now, the only time when i miss them is when i read extremely long texts and would like to have a clue where about in the document I am at the moment.\r\n\r\nTHIS USUALLY NEEDS AT LEAST RELOAD OF PAGE, IN SOME CASES OPENING A NEW TAB OR WINDOW  TO TAKE EFFECT.",
