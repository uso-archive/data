{"id":1845,"info":{"name":"IGN No Ads","description":"Simple script that doesn't seem to break the section links on the left navbar.  Removes the ads in the middle of articles and a few on the main page (on some pages I think); it also centers the text in the login box, because I like the way centered text looks.  I've only tested it on insider.ign.com.  Let me know how it works for you; suits my purposes just fine.","format":"uso","category":"ign","updatedAt":"2007-02-19T18:35:01.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":1869,"name":"The Ev"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1583,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"1845_after.gif","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n/* Written by The Ev for his own purposes because he was annoyed with IGN ads */\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"ign.com\") {\r\n\r\n#MediumRectangleAd, #BillboardAd, #ad-wrap, #leaderboardAd, #HalfPageAd {display: none !important;}\r\n\r\n#loginBox {\r\ntext-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}}
