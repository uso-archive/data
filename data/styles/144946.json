    "description": "Save screen space on duelingnexus by making more UI scroll and fit onto the screen compactly.",
    "additionalInfo": "This css is a basic change splitting the left side view in a game on dueling nexus into two non overlapping parts so they do not obscure each other - they are also both made scrollable to accommodate for the loss of vertical space, along with part of the card image. As duelingnexus itself improves it's UI some parts of this style have been removed when they become redundant.\r\n\r\nThis style is also hosted on <a href=\"https://github.com/Skeletonxf/dueling-nexus-split-view\">github</a> and licensed under MIT. \r\n\r\nThe versions of this code prior to 11/7/17 were hosted under CC0 and are public domain and the versions after that and prior to 21/7/17 were hosted under GPL3.
