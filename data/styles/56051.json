    "description": "This style is aimed to be use to remove that big space in our right in Hotmail.\r\nYou can notice, that even using ads blocker add-ons that space remains empty, making the space to write and read emails really small.\r\nWith this very simple style you can get rid off of that problem easily.",
    "additionalInfo": "To work properly, is better to use first any element blocker like AdBlockPlus add-on and hide the adds there.\r\nThis style DO NOT hide the ads (images, banners, etc), it's only remove the big margin reserved for the ads.\r\nIf dont work properly for you, make sure to check the code. It's very simple and clean, just few lines, so you can add your own domain in case that in your country could be diferent.",
