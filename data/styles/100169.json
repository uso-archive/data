    "description": "This style enlarges the \"large player\" version of YouTube videos. Instead of a fixed width, it tries to expand to almost the entire viewport.",
    "additionalInfo": "This style only affects the \"large player\"/\"theater mode\", which is the button right next to the \"full screen\" button.\r\n\r\nUpdated to work with the new YouTube layout (as of December 2018).\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strike>Video annotations and the progress bar do NOT line up. Impossible to write a CSS-only solution.</strike> Seems fixed as of 2016-06-03.</li>\r\n<li>The video does not take the entire window height, there is the YouTube bar at the top. It is done on purpose, just to make the style work out-of-the-box when you want to watch a video; and also to keep the YouTube UI functional.</li>\r\n<li>The video does not take the entire window height, there is a small space at the bottom. It is done on purpose, because of the horizontal scrollbar that may show up if the window is resized.</li>\r\n<li>3D videos (such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoBfYhAfw7c\">this one</a>) are not resized. That's because I don't think it is posssible to resize a &lt;canvas&gt; element using only CSS while preserving the aspect ratio.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThis style is constantly updated. I update it whenever it gets broken because YouTube changed their code. If you find something wrong/broken, feel free to contact me.",
