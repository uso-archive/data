    "description": "This is my version of MySpace.com... I was not satisfied with the crappy styles on this site, and MySpace has always been full of ads... All I do on the main page is log in, and sometimes I look at the music page... So I removed everything except the login box and changed the background to white... I don't think I can add links to the Music Page through CSS, so I will figure that out later... Comments welcome!!!\r\nP.S. If you want it to look EXACTLY like mine I suggest MySpace Ad / Annoyance remover, although I don't know what it changes, while making the style I noticed minor differences with it disabled...\r\n\r\nHOTFIX : Changed so the page always has a white background... (Forgot to put !important, silly me!)\r\n\r\nEDIT : Updated style to black and white, cleaned it up, removed borders (Please note it looks different from the screenshot)\r\n\r\nHOTFIX : Fixed how it broke my other customization...\r\n\r\nEDIT : Shortened code\r\n\r\nEDIT : Removed Side of Page ads",
