    "description": "Another style to fix the unpleasant new look of tumblr asks. This one's slightly more styled after the original asks, but not exact. There's a bit of emphasis on saving as much space as possible, including making fonts, padding, and icons smaller.",
    "additionalInfo": "<b>08.03.14</b> - fixed a typo that was breaking this on the ssl-secured dashboard\r\n\r\n<b>09.07.13</b> - Now applies when browsing your likes beyond the first page. Also had to change the moz-document rules because userstyles.org wouldn't let me save my edits otherwise. Let me know if there's somewhere that this doesn't work but should!\r\n\r\n<b>09.04.13:</b> Now applies to asks on your inbox pages. Looks like they moved the fugly new style there, too.\r\n\r\n<b>IMPORTANT UPDATE:</b> If you've experienced issues with avatars on tumblr (especially the settings and activity pages) appearing stretched and covering important parts of the layout, update this style! In fact, it's a good idea to do so anyway. There was too broad of a scope for which areas of the site it affected, and that was causing issues with reused classes on other pages. It should now only affect tagged, dashbaord, and posts pages where asks are actually likely to appear. If you notice it not applying to somewhere that asks appear, please let me know using this site.\r\n\r\n<b>Credits:</b> Edited from <a href=\"http://userstyles.org/styles/92387/tumblr-ask-update-fix-more-or-less\">Tumblr Ask Update Fix (more or less)</a>, which is not my creation but is listed as public domain here on userstyles.org.
