{"id":112527,"info":{"name":"Tumblr - Inline images won't scale up","description":"An update of Tumblr's dashboard has made inline images (such as reaction gifs) stretch out to cover the whole width of the post.

This userstyle removes that issue and leaves gifs in the size they should be with a max width of 500px.","format":"uso","category":"tumblr","updatedAt":"2015-04-11T14:48:09.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":289191,"name":"Ellinor Nordgren"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":203,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"112527_after.gif","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(http://www.tumblr.com/),url-prefix(https://www.tumblr.com/){\r\n  .tmblr-full, .tmblr-embed {\r\n    margin: 0px!important;\r\n    display: inline-block;\r\n  }\r\n    \r\n  .tmblr-full img, .tmblr-embed img  {\r\n    min-width: 0px!important;\r\n    max-width: 500px!important;\r\n  }\r\n}"}}
