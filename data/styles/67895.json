    "description": "Get rid of Google+'s trending box. Its content is utterly useless. Say X is trending, even if you want to know what it is all about, 90% of the posts under #X will all just say, \"HEY OMG X iS TRENDING!! YAYYY! XOXOXOO\" or \"Look at my new cat pic! (#ListOfAllTrendingThings)\". Tried to figure out why Pixar was trending this morning, never found out (at least without leaving G+). \r\n\r\nAs an added benefit, with this fix, the name Justin Bieber won't appear on your G+ ever again (that is if you have trustworthy friends).",
