The script infowars_xtroll will automatically delete the posts of trolls you specify in infowars.com, if you're getting tired of looking at them.  Or, you just can make trolls say random things instead.  The style here just prevents the troll posts from appearing briefly before being deleted.","format":"uso","category":"infowars","updatedAt":"2011-05-24T03:16:19.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":102651,"name":"Mark_13"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":106,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"48306-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(http://www.infowars.com/)\r\n{\r\n  .commentlist {    \r\n    display: none\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n"}}
