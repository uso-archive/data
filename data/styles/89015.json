{"id":89015,"info":{"name":"Google+ cuts off main content columns","description":"Google+'s new layout causes smaller screen widths to look terrible because it always reserves space for the Hangouts bar, which cuts off the leftmost main content column.\r\n\r\nThis fixes that by no longer reserving any room for the bar.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to only occur in Chrome, and does not effect Firefox users. Doesn't hurt anything in FF if installed though.","format":"uso","category":"google","updatedAt":"2013-06-12T18:09:59.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":192848,"name":"pigsflew.com","homepage":"http://pigsflew.com"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":44,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"89015_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"plus.google.com\") {\r\n    .dNa, div.Fq.l8, .Foa {\r\n        margin-right: auto!important;\r\n    }\r\n    .mu {\r\n        padding: 0!important;    \r\n    }\r\n}"}}
