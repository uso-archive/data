    "description": "A modification to the No Bias style. This style shrinks the text that shows the time passed since the comment was posted. This is useful to those who want to remove the mental comment score bias, but still see the number preceding the measurement of time as the comment score in some subconscious way. The time since posted text is shrunk so that you can't just glance at it and internalize it as a reflection of the post's quality. You know, if you're easily manipulated like that.",
