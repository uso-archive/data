{"id":3601,"info":{"name":"Fix Google Widescreen View","description":"With the latest run of Google Reader updates, I noticed that when I removed the sidebar using the toggle button between the sidebar and the main screen - I would get the scrollbar pushed out of the browser.  Looking around for a fix - I found out if you removed the toggle between the menu and body of Google Reader it would fix the problem.  Hopefully this is only a temp. fix till Google gets things corrected.  First public user style - so be nice. ;)","format":"uso","category":"google","updatedAt":"2007-09-27T06:13:15.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":4205,"name":"Mitch"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1011,"weekly":1}},"screenshots":{"main":"3601_after.gif","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.google.com/reader/\"), url-prefix(\"https://www.google.com/reader/\") {\r\n\r\n\r\n/* remove toggler */\r\n#nav-toggler {\r\n  display: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}}
