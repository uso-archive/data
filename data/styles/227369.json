    "description": "This is a quick background to add an image of your choice behind all the Spacehey pages. This doesn't overwrite people's profiles if they have their own image and applies everywhere else.\r\n\r\nTo change the background all you have to do is edit the style and change the image url at the top of the code to whatever you want :)\r\n\r\nMake sure the image is either 1080p so it can fit the whole page, or a pattern that can repeat. If the image can't fit the entire page it'll repeat instead.",
