My next\r\ntarget is to do the restyling of the cpanel/siteselection/login\r\nscreen  alltogether   Please dont request for me to modify the site like\r\nget rid of the captcha and stuff like that, im not the webmaster, i hate\r\nwhen people ask me that.. so please. dont. I can only make CSS style changes\r\nand CSS only allows for some html changing, which i feel could be better but\r\nI guess that would be considered hacking the site... now wouldnt it. But\r\nreally, i guess if you dont want it restyled at all just make the whole thing\r\njava or something. I have and always will represent freedom of customization\r\nwhen it comes to color. Many of us hate the white background, thats gonna\r\nbe the next thing to change... ok?   Please do request color schemes.\r\n\r\nUPDATE APRIL 17 2013\r\nas much as i'd like to get rid of \"EARN MONEY\" tab on the top-right\r\ntab bar, it is in fact using the old MAP element, which is not CSS at all\r\nand unfortunately cant be manipulated... i could hide it I guess but then\r\nyou wouldnt have access to the other links, if you dont care uncomment the\r\nthing anways, its available below under \"header\"\r\n\r\nif cpanel changes the position of the tables, you must change\r\nthe numbers, if you dont use adblock you will need to block the\r\ncontent tables as well -- this css style will do this for you\r\nwithout the need for adblock at all, but ONLY for this page\r\nyou will need adblock for the rest of the site if you want it\r\nI find it annoying when trying to build a site having ads smack\r\nin the middle of my face, if anything it will make me change to\r\na different free provider who wont (and they ARE out there)\r\n\r\nthese elements listed below corrospond to these parts (as of 3/23/2013)\r\nbut may change position, id, and/or classnames over time (i may\r\nor may not update this in the future hard to say, best thing to do\r\nis update it yourself)\r\n\r\n#container>#maincontent>div>p  =  \"if you like our serv...ys\" paragraph\r\n#container>#maincontent>div>table  =  the link/donate/pay for services links following the above\r\n#sidebar1>p>a>img  = the \"Upgrade to Premium Service\" picture ad below your account info\r\nbody>div>div>table:nth-child(5)  =  the \"sponsors\" table\r\nbody>div>div>table:nth-child(7) = the \"get a premium domain name\" and \"get yourdomain.com for free!\" table\r\n\r\nnote that you can get a yourdomain.tk for free, you dont need to spend money on a domain that is 100% your own\r\nthe internet was founded as a free place, theres supposed to be no charge for basic internet services like domain names\r\nand stuff like that, the only cost is supposed to be in actual services that might have costs... even this most the time\r\ncan be found free... as you can see, the rich fancy websites pay so that us poor websites can exist without having to...\r\ni encourage you if you have lots of money to support and do your part however!\r\n\r\n(im poor to the bone)\r\n*/\r\n#container>#maincontent>div>p,\r\n#container>#maincontent>div>table,\r\n#sidebar1>p>a>img,\r\n/* i had to change this to 7 and 9, put this back to 5 and 7 if\r\nyou experience problems, this may be due to the 'attack' notifications\r\nthat it gives sometimes */\r\n\r\nbody>div>div>table[id=\"sharedtable\"]:nth-child(7),\r\nbody>div>div>table[id=\"sharedtable\"]:nth-child(9)\r\n{\r\ndisplay:none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*\r\nthis _should_ hide the DDOS attack notice\r\nif it hides the main menu, then they changed their site again\r\nand you will need to comment this out, the only difference between\r\nthe DDOS table and the main menu table is the \"border=0\" tag, other\r\nthan that they are identical except that DDOS is NOT a sharedtable\r\nclass id, but i felt that it could break things worse if i did it that\r\nway----comment these lines out if you dont want/need DDOS attack info\r\nto be blocked\r\n*/\r\ndiv#mainContent>table[border=\"0\"]\r\n{\r\ndisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* in my opnion, the domain combobox is hard to read when it is so small\r\ncomment this out for regular size, its precent so even small screens shouldnt\r\nsuffer, and its only the minimum size, larger screens wont be affected!*/\r\nselect#accountID\r\n{\r\nmin-width: 50%;\r\n-moz-appearance: button;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://members.000webhost.com/?login_hash\") \r\n{\r\n/* this is for the cpanel access page ONLY \r\n   (gets rid of the EARN MONEY ad */\r\ndiv#sidebar1>p+p\r\n{\r\ndisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n/************       header        (all pages) ***********************/\r\n/*\r\n    Uncomment this if you want it, this will remove the image map and\r\n    all the tabs, and display the logo without the tabs, which is fine if\r\n    you don't use them, otherwise you may want them on.
