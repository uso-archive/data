    "additionalInfo": "- Everything should be themed, regardless if you use the free or paid version of Google Play Music\r\n- Everything means even context menus and less frequently visited pages\r\n- In addition to vanilla style, it gives the user more decent button feedbacks (hover effects), which makes it easier to navigate when you are sitting on a couch in front of your tv! (maybe how google should have done it?) \r\n- Sidebar customizations - hide unwanted buttons\r\n- Color customizations - choose your preferred accent color\r\n- I am an active user of Google Play Music and try to maintain this theme as fast as possible\r\n- Mainly tested with Firefox\r\n- Chrome/Opera should work as good as Firefox - will always keep an eye on it\r\n- Every single line of code should be documented to make it easier for you to customize if you are only a little bit familiar with css\r\n\r\n... tell me if you find a bug or something not themed!\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n<u>Changelog:</u>\r\n\r\n10/29/16 - v1.0.67\r\n- fixed indicator arrow color for top bar buttons\r\n\r\n10/24/16 - v1.0.66\r\n- fixed not working effect when selecting the currently playing song\r\n- fixed account menu\r\n\r\n09/23/16 - v1.0.65\r\n- reworked currently playing song row in playlists a little bit\r\n\r\n09/14/16 - v1.0.64\r\n- changed default accent color to #FF5722 (googles new default color since April 2016)\r\n- reworked edit album cover buttons at edit info/details page\r\n- fixed shortly appearing white background when overlay background will get closed (e.g. when edit album info gets closed)\t\r\n- fixed hover effect for repeat button when active\r\n\r\n09/11/16 - v1.0.63\r\n- fixed currently playing song background at playlists (thanks to Kévin Scatton and Alex Weiner for reporting)\r\n\r\n09/11/16 - v1.0.62\r\n- totally overhauled share page when sharing via google+ (some minor polishing left)\r\n- Chrome: fixed some missing webkit-filters\r\n\r\n09/09/16 - v1.0.61\r\n- fixed search suggestions hover effect at search bar\r\n- fixed account picture hover effect not working when hovering change button\r\n- Chrome: reworked some minor things at settings page only visible for chrome users\r\n\r\n09/08/16 - v1.0.60\r\n- changed color of play count and duration in playlists\r\n- reworked play button hovering on material cards\r\n- added box shadows for buttons of google account popup menu and reworked them a bit\r\n- changed color of lab dividers and of descriptions after header at settings page\r\n- Firefox: reworked upload page a bit\r\n- minor code cleanup\r\n\r\n09/07/16 - v1.0.59\r\n- fixed account menu (upper right)\r\n- made loading spinner a bit thicker at playlists sidebar\r\n\r\n09/05/16 - v1.0.58\r\n- Chrome: inverted particles screensaver to fit with the dark design.
