{"id":17330,"info":{"name":"Editor - Removed background image for locked files","description":"In the devunity editor, the background graphic for locked files is white - and the text is mostly white also.

This css just removed the graphic until they fix what I assume is a bug.","format":"uso","category":"devunity","updatedAt":"2009-04-26T19:44:45.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":22806,"name":"Justin_"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":72,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"17330_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"devunity.com\") {\r\n.codeSegmentContainer_locked, .codeSegmentMouseOver {\r\nbackground-image:none !important ;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n"}}
