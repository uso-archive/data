    "description": "I was planning on adding it to my other style: style 58169, but since the playlist/favorite bar is a useful (Non the less, annoying) tool, i decided to make a style just for it. That way you can disable this style anytime you want the playlist/favorite bar to spawn at the bottom without moving anything to the video player.\r\n\r\nThis works great along with my other style: style 58169 The only difference is that this one works on every browser, every screen resolution.",
    "additionalInfo": "1.0\r\n- No big deal... it's just about hiding that annoying bar. Oh, it also removes the Feedback button.\r\n*Remember that i have another Style to make the video player bigger* (Look the description for the link)",
