{"id":58170,"info":{"name":"Remove 'Playlist bar'/'Favorites bar' from Youtube","description":"I was planning on adding it to my other style: style 58169, but since the playlist/favorite bar is a useful (Non the less, annoying) tool, i decided to make a style just for it. That way you can disable this style anytime you want the playlist/favorite bar to spawn at the bottom without moving anything to the video player.\r\n\r\nThis works great along with my other style: style 58169 The only difference is that this one works on every browser, every screen resolution.","format":"uso","category":"youtube","updatedAt":"2011-12-19T16:35:10.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":127255,"name":"MasterAmateur"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1058,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"58170_after.jpeg","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":2,"commentsCount":1}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"www.youtube.com\") {\r\n#playlist-bar {\r\ndisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n#yt-feedback {\r\ndisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}}
