    "description": "Do you like making large tier lists? Do you hate having to zoom out and scroll to place your items? Then this style is for you! Keep those items on hand and easy to access no matter how big your tier list is.",
    "additionalInfo": "The image carousel, usually at the bottom of every tier list, will now be fixed to the bottom of your screen, following you wherever you scroll. This makes it a lot easier to make big tier lists. I made this for myself when I wanted to make a tier list for Binding of Isaac items, but just couldn't stand the default interface the site provides on PC.",
