    "description": "Bookmark folders shown without icons in BLUE, and any bookmark not in a folder would be considered special and would be shown without icons in RED.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to use minimum real estate for Bookmarks Toolbar, so folders are used almost exclusively, and try to keep the folder names to 1-4 characters.&nbsp; I know what my folders are so they don't need long names.\r\n\r\nThis is for Firefox 4 thru Firefox 28.\r\nThe <b>Firefox 29</b> version is style 101569 (101569).\r\nThe Firefox 3.6 version can be found in style 9091 (9091)",
    "additionalInfo": "Most of  my keyword shortcuts are in a personal toolbar folder named \"K\" which you can see at http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/lessons/intro/k.html it also includes the one bookmarklet (\"gg:fix\") that I keep directly on the personal bookmarks toolbar  and write-up can be seen at  http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/lessons/intro/fx4_intro.htm#kws\r\n\r\nRecommended Companions:  \r\nstyle 24728 (24728)\r\nstyle 9043 (9043)\r\nstyle 18553 (18553)\r\n\r\nThis is one of several styles to minimize size of toolbars.&nbsp; To save more toolbar space see styles listed by my name at the top of the page (user 12592).  About half of my styles are involved with making toolbars more compact AND easier to view.\r\nstyle 9350 (9350) \r\nstyle 18864 (18864)\r\nstyle 9349 (9349)  \r\nstyle 13211 (13211)   \r\nstyle 9514 (9514).\r\n\r\nThe bookmark separators cause bookmarks in each group to be sorted separately so on the bookmarks toolbar I can see a group of bookmarks in the midst of folders and the will remain undisturbed when sorting bookmarks.\r\n\r\n<b>Before and After shots</b> will not show up here on userstyles.org as intended where you used to be able to view both at once without rescaling, but that was a long time ago.&nbsp; If you click on the before and after shots individually here at userstyles you will see that you can see twice as many folders and bookmarks with the style and read them better.&nbsp; Would suggest you look where you can really compare the difference and actually see what this is about in reducing the size of the tabs bar both vertically, and in being able to show more tabs at once as more are added.\r\nhttp://dmcritchie.mvps.org/firefox/tabs.htm#tabsbar \r\n\r\nUpdates, since 2008-07-26\r\n2008-10-07 Changed  to suggested font-size 10px rather than default and expecting user to modify.\r\n2011-04-22 updated for Fx4 from style-9091, separators & height",
