    "description": "Facebook added this new feature that is suppose to let users know what is \"real news\" and \"fake news\". First off, they are using Wikipedia as their info source, and Wikipedia isn't always reliable, and second, Facebook is using this to portray all Conservative news outlets as \"Fake News\", and all Liberal news outlets as \"Real News\". Using this UserStyle is your way of giving Facebook the middle finger for trying to influence their users.",
