    "description": "This style reduces the height of the ad area of the new Scout.com forums (forums.scout.com).  I found that although the Ad-block extension took care of removing the ad on the top of the page, there was still a blank block where the ad was supposed to be.  This sets .SuperBanner's height to 0, thus reducing that height.\r\n\r\nGo Deacs!",
