    "additionalInfo": "Google keeps rearranging things in the new look, which means this style breaks sometimes.  And sometimes Google uses the old look, which will break with this style active.  Sometimes you might need to disable the style to see if they're using the old look again.  I also edit the style sometimes to match their latest changes.",
