    "description": "Recently Tumblr added an update that changed the position of icons, making them stay visible at the side of the posts as you scroll down your dashboard. I found this distracting so I wrote something up quickly to make it not do that.",
    "additionalInfo": "<strong>Updated January 14th 2015:</strong> Recent Tumblr update changed the class names used for the scrolling avatars for Chrome/older versions of Firefox. Script has been changed accordingly\r\n<strong>Updated January 10th 2015:</strong> Added additional code for Firefox compatibility (testing was only done on Chrome initially). Thanks to Mar L for suggesting what code to use",
