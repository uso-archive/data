    "description": "Allows the bio box on the Clan Profile Screen to expand to show more of the bio without scrolling.",
    "additionalInfo": "The tiny little clan bio box always bothered me, and after seeing no styles to remedy this issue, I decided to whip one up myself. \r\n\r\nThis style allows the bio box to expand up to a certain amount. By default, that amount is set at 1000px, but it can be set to any number that fits your screen. The limit can even be removed altogether!\r\n\r\n<b>Tweaking Guide:</b>\r\n\r\n1) Go to www.flightrising.com\r\n2) Click on the Stylish Icon in the top right corner. \r\n3) Click the \"...\" icon in the top right corner.\r\n4) Select \"Manage All Styles\" to reach your list of installed styles. \r\n5) Find \"Expanding Clan/User Bio Box - Flight Rising\", click edit. \r\n6) To adjust the limit, change the pixel amount on both \"max-height\" tags. Make sure both are the same number. To remove the limit, delete both \"max-height\" lines. \r\n7) Click \"save\" in the top left-hand corner, under the style name.\r\n8) Continue to adjust to your liking. \r\n\r\nNote: It's a pretty simple style, only a few lines of code, however, if it gives you any problems, let me know!\r\n\r\n<b>---UPDATE: Made more user friendly to tweak and edit, added a min-height tag.---</b>",
