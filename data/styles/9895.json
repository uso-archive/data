    "description": "When the AutoPager Firefox extension detects a stream-able page, the popup it displays will be transparent, allowing you to see the web content behind it.  \r\n\r\nThe popup will then return back to normal display when you Hover your Mouse over the popup!\r\n\r\nObviously, you must have the Firefox Add-on \"Auto Pager\" installed (installer link below)\r\n\r\n* An original style, but I wish to say Thanks to user 6431 for introducing me into the realm of Transparency with style 6771\r\n\r\nYou can Customize the amount of transparency by editing the Opacity in the code (Closer to 0 is closer to invisible, whereas closer to 1 is closer to fully-visible - EXAMPLE: 0.5 is in the middle of opacity)  Currently, the code has it at .6 see-thru (which means it is 40% transparent and 60% opaque)\r\n\r\nThis makes your Auto-Pager detections easier to see behind, allowing you to view all the web page content without moving your mouse, blocking the text or images!\r\n\r\nApplies to:\r\n+ Transparency on your on screen notification area for each web site's Autopager Popup\r\n+ This is an \"Until Hovered Over\" style, meaning that the popup will be transparent until you hover your mouse over it, it will then turn opaque and allow you to see the contents easier.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.\r\n+ This style is FULLY customizable, and you can set the transparency to be almost invisible, almost opaque or anything in between!\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n+ Works on Firefox 3\r\n+ Works on Firefox 2\r\n\r\nIntegrates with the following Styles:\r\n+ Style 10319\r\n+ Style 8818\r\n+ Style 9650\r\n\r\n** Must have the AutoPager installed on Firefox ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4925 )\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.2:\r\n+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.1:\r\n+ BUGFIX: Was working only on https: sites.  (Fixed)\r\n+ Added proper code formatting (using case)\r\n+ Now works on sites such as Google",
