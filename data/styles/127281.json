Sadly some people insist upon using Shitbook, which means we must log-in to the SHIT to message them.\r\n\r\nThis user-style will <b><u>HIDE ALL</u> of the posts</b> <u>in the Facebook (Shitbook) news feed</u>. <i>The collective <b>timeline</b> (best of and most recent posts regarding friends or people you follow) is <b>hidden</b>.</i> This allows you to use the chat/message function without being distracted by all the shit people post to the news-feed timeline.\r\n\r\nInstead of posts in the news feed you just see a blank space. Lovely! Fuck off Mark Zuckerberg, I hate you!\r\n\r\nI have no idea if people will like or use this style, but here is it nevertheless.\r\n\r\nCrippled Shitbook functionality, via this style, will remind you to either not log-in or log-out sooner rather than later.","format":"uso","category":"facebook","updatedAt":"2016-04-29T08:01:16.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":264740,"name":"SingularityUtopia"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":168,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"127281_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix('http://www.facebook.' ) , url-prefix('https://www.facebook.' ) , url-prefix('http://facebook.' ) , url-prefix('https://facebook.' )\r\n\r\n\r\n{\r\n\r\n#stream_pagelet\r\n\r\n  {\r\n     display: none !important; \r\n  }\r\n\r\n}"}}
