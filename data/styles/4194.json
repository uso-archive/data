{"id":4194,"info":{"name":"myspace full screen fixed- works with new skin","description":"I was messing with the other full screen style because the top was colliding with each other. i thought that this was alot better also because it shows friends normally and not in a line. I fixed it to look normal. \r\n          You can edit how much you want it fullscreen (I have it at 95% since i have a widescreen and i just wanted myspace to look better), but i think you have to make the other % lower so they add to 100%. \r\n        I want to add that i really didnt no what I was doing but this style is very nice (at least to me anyways).. It only makes it full screen and keeps the content intact so it still feels like myspace. I hope this helps people because I know it is alot better for me.","format":"uso","category":"myspace","updatedAt":"2007-11-20T19:44:55.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":4956,"name":"drflux"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1377,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"4194-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n@-moz-document domain(myspace.com) {\r\n\ttd#westGutter, td#eastGutter{width:5% !important;}\r\n\t form, div#wrap, table#MainTable, col.col2, td#mainGutter, div#SplashContentWrap{width:95% !important; text-align: center;}\r\n}"}}
