    "description": "Hate Google Preview? Want to just get rid of it simply? Luckily this is fairly easy.\r\n\r\nThis merely hides the related HTML sections that display both on mouse over and on clicking the icon, as well as the icon itself. Doing so seems to prevent the results from even loading the images. If the preview images loading is still a concern add this to Adblock's filter list: google.com/webpagethumbnail\r\n\r\nAlso, this should not interfere with any other sort of Disable Google Being Stupid styles.",
