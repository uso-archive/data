{"id":3759,"info":{"name":"fsdaily.com","description":"FSdaily please don't put the ads on the left, they destroy the page. Please place you're ads in a less jarring location, so it doesn't interrupt the content. :) Thanks. To use this you need also the firefox adblock add-on. This style will increase the size of the content area, hide the breadcrumb, as well as shift the content so it aligns flush left. I am also rocking the Firefox Nasa theme, if you wanted to know.","format":"uso","category":"fsdaily","updatedAt":"2007-10-10T19:27:31.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":4396,"name":"braydonfuller"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":89,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"3759_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document domain(fsdaily.com) {\r\n  .news-summary {left:-175px; width:125%;}\r\n  #wrap2 {left:0px;}\r\n  #breadcrumbs {display:none;}\r\n}"}}
