    "additionalInfo": "Note, I have not personally tested this on any browser save Chrome. \r\n<strong>PLEASE CONTACT ME HERE WITH ANY QUESTIONS ---> <a href=\"http://goodbyemidnight.tumblr.com\">goodbyemidnight.tumblr.com</a> <-----</strong>\r\nI do, however, work full time so I'll get to them as soon as I can.\r\n\r\n<strong>4/8/2015 2:45PM</strong> - Wow we had a long run without these. Tumblr made the inline images full width. idk why. But now they're not.\r\n<strong>11/18/14 12:00AM</strong> - Fixed the video issues in Firefox. They're full width again, sorry, i can't give them margins without them completely breaking :/ Some people claimed margin issues in Firefox and I couldn't reproduce it, but I hope the fixes took care of it either way.\r\n<strong>11/13/14 1:40PM</strong> - Sorry, didn't catch everything yesterday. Videos should be fixed now as well as inline images! \r\n<strong>11/12/14 1:50PM</strong> - Tumblr made an update. MY FAVORITE! They changed how some of their photo classes work. Who knows, it's weird. Let's see if these two changes fix it.  \r\n<strong>11/7/14 6:20PM</strong> - Tumblr made an update that changed the max width photos are on the dash. I think they're kinda sorta trying to fix the upload issue. But only kinda. Anyway, fixed the issue of photos that are larger than 500px getting cut off. \r\n<strong>11/4/14 3PM</strong> - Alright, after some consideration I'm removing the fix for photosets on individual blogs and leaving this as just a dash fix. That said, the fix for viewing <em>photosets on other people's blogs</em> is going to be offered as <a href=\"https://userstyles.org/styles/106863/fix-for-images-on-tumblr-blogs\">a separate style HERE</a>. It causes some issues with certain blogs but I know some people still want to use it so it's a hard call. Tumblr did some ridiculous things to their photo API and there's only so much I can do with CSS alone. To fix your personal blog so that anyone can view it properly, with or without a stylish code downloaded, please consider <a href=\"http://jumpingpuddles.tumblr.com/post/101488809743\">this javascript code here by jumpingpuddles</a>.\r\n<strong>10/30/14 10:30 PM EST</strong> - Another update, sorry. But I should have all my bases covered by now. I hope. If not, please message me at goodbyemidnight.tumblr.com\r\n<strong>11/1/14 12PM</strong> - Update to fix photo widths on tumblr blogs. I didn't include the margins in the code cause it could do funky things to themes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease check out my other styles to bring back the old tumblr.\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://userstyles.org/styles/106837/bring-back-the-old-tumblr-blue\">Bring Back the Old Tumblr Blue</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://userstyles.org/styles/106789/best-of-both-worlds-new-tumblr\">Best of Both Worlds New Tumblr</a> -- Disable the \"fix photos\" code to use.
