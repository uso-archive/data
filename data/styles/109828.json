    "description": "Another tumblr change, another fix. Keep the text edit buttons while you type in a text post, no selecting required.",
    "additionalInfo": "Created 1/28/15 6:30pm EST --Will need some more tweaks I'm sure, but it's functioning right now so take it and run.\r\n\r\n\r\n1/30/15 - Updated to be fixed on the page so it scrolls with you and the type box as you type. Also... PLEASE DO NOT ASK ME TO MAKE AN HTML BUTTON. It's not within the ability of this site (which is for CSS edits/overrides only) nor is it within my skill set to make an effective button. If you really truly use HTML to a heavy extent, go to https://www.tumblr.com/settings/dashboard and change your default text editor. Beyond that, consider why and how you're using HTML so heavily in your posts on a site that does not call for it nor need it.\r\n2/2/15 - The fixed sorta didn't work on like any screen other than the main page. hopefully this works out a little better. Sorry it doesn't scroll with you if I can figure out how to magic that, I will. Til then, take this.",
