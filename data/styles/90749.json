To hide it only on your main blog so it still shows up on any side blogs you have, just change \"YOUR-USERNAME-HERE\" to your own username in the \"Applies to\" field in Stylish. To hide follower count on all your blogs, insert https://www.tumblr.com/ instead.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Tumblr just changed the URL for the activity page, so it should now look like this:\r\nhttps://www.tumblr.com/blog/YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/activity","format":"uso","category":"tumblr","updatedAt":"2014-11-01T22:59:30.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":197762,"name":"sciencensorcery"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1460,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"90749_after.jpeg","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":1,"commentsCount":1}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document url-prefix(\"https://www.tumblr.com/blog/YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/activity\") {\r\n.ui_stats .row .unit.right.total_followers{\r\n       display: none;\r\n\t}\r\n}"}}
