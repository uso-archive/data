Read the release notes for details.</i>\r\n\r\nA theme based on Gross', Garratt's Dad's, colors, with shiny white slime, and black and blue body highlights.\r\n\r\n<b>Activation instructions in release notes.</b>\r\n\r\n<i>FA FurAffinity Black Slime Gross' Colors Cooped</i>",
    "additionalInfo": "<b><u>Activation Instructions</u></b> \r\n\r\n<i>I borked Chrome installation links during the last update.  Just edit theme and copy and paste the two lines below.  They have the proper references now.  That's what I get for copy and pasting in a rush.</i>\r\n\r\n<b>Chrome users install with Stylish, then edit, and add these lines to the code to activate the theme:</b>\r\n\r\n<i><blockquote>@import url(\"http://www.BlackSlime.com/Stylish4Chrome/BSMFA_Core_News.css\");\r\n@import url(\"http://www.BlackSlime.com/Stylish4Chrome/Gross'_Version_FA.css\");</blockquote></i>\r\n\r\n<b>Firefox users install with Stylish, then edit, and remove the</b> <i>/*</i> <b>and</b> <i>*/</i> <b>from around the first @import line.</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b><u>Updates</u></b>\r\n\r\n2014.08.12\r\n----------------------------------\r\nIf you already have a FurAffinity Style by Cooped, it should automatically update to a new code base.  I've gone through and rewritten all CSS modules for better consistency and ease of design.  Some styles even get a radical redesign to make them better than they were, hopefully.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a FurAffinity Style by Cooped, feel free to try one on.  I've updated all the screenshots for the new updates.  Don't forget as a first timer to read the activation notes.  There's one more step to installation than a normal user style.  This activates an auto update system where you never have to keep track of updates for the styles you use.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, I've rewritten all code for all styles, so try out some of the other themes under FurAffinity and Cooped.  While still sharing core functionalities, each style is unique and packs a different flavor from its counter parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n2014.07.19\r\n----------------------------------\r\nInitial Upload, Compatible with Firefox 28+ and Chrome 4+, Activation instructions below.",
