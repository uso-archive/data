    "description": "**** <b>Firefox 29 and above should use style 101570</b> (101570) and must still install an experimental extension...<br>Firefox 3.6 through Firefox 28 users should use style 24728  (24728) along with an experimental extension described there.\r\n  ****\r\n\r\nColors the bottom border of a tab with  RED for active tab,  BLUE  for a normal tab,  GREEN for a still unread tab.   In other words distinguishes tabs as active tab, viewed tab, unviewed tab.  Does not affect the background color of a tab  so that color usage of  \"Perma Tabs\"  (\"Perma Tabs Mod\"), and/or \"Multiple Tab Handler\"  extensions will prevail.",
    "additionalInfo": "<small>You must scroll to see all of Notes.</small>\r\n\r\nBottom border color will show up even if tabs on the tabs bar have been squeezed down so much that only the favicon can be seen.\r\n\r\n=================================================\r\nPlease vote on getting  Bug 487242  fixed to regain full benefits of this style in Firefox 3.6 \r\n  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=487242\r\n\r\nTest code can be found in style 24728 \r\nbut you will need the TabVisited extension only found in Bug 487242\r\n=================================================\r\n\r\nAn unread tab is one that has been opened in the background such as with a mouse shortcut,  and will also be seen for tabs restored from a terminated session.\r\n\r\nWhen a tab is opened in the  background the current tab remains active (Ctrl+Shift+click) \r\nWhen a tab is opened in the foreground the the new tab becomes active (Ctrl+click).\r\nThe mouse shortcuts  that I use above are reversed from Firefox's default because I checkmark the option at  Tools, Options, Tabs, [x] When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately.   \r\n\r\nMy method of reading most web pages is to stay within the article, opening links in the background at the far right of the tabs bar, when I have finished reading all of the originally selected pages, I start reading the new pages in the same manner, new tabs to the a right after all they are secondary material.   I try not to build up layers within a tab, so that I can tell for sure when I am finished with a tab.    Especially when reading Blogs where I start with several blogs by opening them from a folder on my bookmarks toolbar.\r\n\r\nIf \"private browsing\" for the active tab in particular can be determined might add an  dotted black  border  at top of tab.   [Unfortunately Private Browsing is all or nothing it is not per tab].\r\n   border-top: dotted 2px  #FF6600  !important;\r\n\r\nThis style can be used together  with  style 9043 (9043) by user 12592.\r\n\r\nProblem with Firefox 3.6 (Namoroka),  visited tabs appear same as unvisited tabs both are showing green underscores.   Works okay all versions through Firefox 3.5 (Shiretoko).  [see Bug 487242]  Please vote on getting the Bug fixed if you want to continue full benefits of this style in Firefox 3.6 and later.  With the ordering of new tabs opened in the background in 3.6 you will really need to know which tabs have been visited or and which are unvisited.   \r\n\r\nUpdates to code since 2008-07-24  (none)",
