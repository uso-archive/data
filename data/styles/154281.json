    "description": "The URL and the Tabs' bar colored in black to make it cohesive with the dark mode on Mozilla. Also I have added a 50px space on the right of the menu button—addons, options, etc.— because it was hidden by my Windows toolbar which I have on the right of the screen.",
    "additionalInfo": "-2018/9/13: the last update on Mozilla Quantum v.64 messed up some of the colors. With this fix—I mean mine—you can choose the Black Shine theme. Before that I could not get rid of the grey background on some menus as in Tool Menu or similar. Now it is an all black theme.\r\n\r\n-If you do not know how to change Chrome.css in Mozilla do a Google search. It is relatively easy to find a tutorial that fits your knowledge level.\r\n\r\n-The last feature—the space to the left—it is hidden by default so If you want this feature just delete in the code the two \"/* */\" with the text inside. Not the code just the \r\n\r\n[b]/* delete this text between \"/ *\" if you want the menu button to the left as in the image[/b]\r\n[i]#Leave the code here intact[/i]\r\n\r\n[b]*/[/b]",
