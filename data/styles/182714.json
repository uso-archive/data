    "name": "Google - Fix menu accessibility",
    "description": "<b>As of september 2020, this stylesheet is not necessary anymore.</b> At least in the browsers I test, google has fixed its styles...\r\n\r\nEarly april, google changed some parameters in its stylesheet. Since then, when accessing the \"Settings\" menu on google search homepage, some of the items can be unclickable depending on the size of the window.\r\nIt's due to the fact that in html the form is taking the whole width of the page and is displayed over the menu.\r\nIn the screenshot I've set a red background, partially transparent, to the form. You can see that it overlaps the menu (opaque yellow background).\r\nWhen this fix is applied, the menu is displayed in front and is clickable.\r\n\r\nFor more userscripts, styles, extensions, tips, ..., visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://procyon-b.github.io/programming/\">my programming page</a>.",
    "additionalInfo": "The problem was fixed by google around 2020/04/26,\r\nbut it reappeared. I noticed it today 2020/05/17\r\nApparently fixed... for the time being... 2020/09",
