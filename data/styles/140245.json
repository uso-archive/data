    "description": "Hides average ratings on Goodreads because sometimes I want to browse book descriptions or update my lists for books that I have been recommended elsewhere before knowing what the general consensus is and creating an anchoring effect for my own read. Ratings by individuals will still show - considered hiding those as well but they are harder to run into accidentally so usually at that point I am actually looking for them.",
