{"id":8213,"info":{"name":"AwesomeBar Results Sized Down","description":"I didn't like the minimalist styles for the AwesomeBar results that removed the title.\r\nSo I made my own that just turns the size of the text down and pushes everything a little closer.\r\n\r\nedit in response to Alaaddin:\r\nThis style was made on Vista...for Vista...and I have been using it since the first public Beta on Windows 7. Just installed it on a new reinstall (less than an hour old) of the release candidate and I am still happy with this style. I suggest you go with a different style or create your own if you do not like mine.\r\n\r\nThank you to those who actually did like the improvements I made.","format":"uso","category":"browser","updatedAt":"2008-06-21T17:57:18.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":11539,"name":"Thor79"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1277,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"8213_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":5,"commentsCount":6}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document url(\"chrome://browser/content/browser.xul\")\r\n{\r\n\r\n.autocomplete-richlistitem\r\n{\r\nheight: 26px !important;\r\noverflow: hidden !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.ac-title\r\n{\r\nmargin-top: -7px;\r\nfont-size: 85%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.ac-url\r\n{\r\nmargin-top:-16px;\r\nfont-size: 90%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}}
