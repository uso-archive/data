I would recommend using url-prefix and only copying the spreadsheet link up to \"edit#gid=\" (numbers) so you can use it on every tab of the spreadsheet you add.\r\n- Use fullscreen on your browser for maximum effect.\r\n- You may want to add hyperlinks to your spreadsheet if you are using multiple tabs.\r\n- If you need to edit the spreadsheet, disable the style then enter + exit fullscreen mode in either order.\r\n- By default, this affects my \"Hunting set search list\" which does have hyperlinks and my \"Sheet Engine\".",
