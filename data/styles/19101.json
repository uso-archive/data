{"id":19101,"info":{"name":"Metafilter change visited link color","description":"This script allows you to change the visited link color across the Metafilter sites. It was so close to white that after I clicked on a link in a long narrative (especially on AskMe) I had a hard time finding it again. Note: Plutor, of Mefi Greasemonkey script writing fame, wrote this for me. Thanks Plutor!\r\n\r\nBy default the visited link color is changed to a light brown. Edit the script in Stylish and change the HTML code to anything you like.","format":"uso","category":"metafilter","updatedAt":"2009-11-01T20:09:38.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":11119,"name":"KatGamer"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":377,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"19101-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"metafilter.com\") {\r\n  a:visited {\r\n    color: #B79471 !important;\r\n  } \r\n}"}}
