{"id":18389,"info":{"name":"Xbox360Achievements.org Wide Minimal","description":"I was experiencing some problems with elements on the site overlapping, particularly on the Achievement Guide pages, plus the big margins on the left & right sides kinda bugged me. This makes the main content portion of the site span the entire browser window, as opposed to an absolute 1000 pixels. I also removed the useless top banner graphic. Finally, because the resizing causes the graphics to go even more out of alignment, I simply removed all the background graphics and changed the background to simple white. This is my first Stylish script and I used it as an opportunity to start teaching myself about how CSS works :) I might make a better version at some point, but for now it works fine.\r\n\r\nNote that the advertising on this site is not present in my screenshots thanks to AdBlock Plus.","format":"uso","category":"xbox360achievements","updatedAt":"2009-05-31T21:20:26.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":24261,"name":"Patrick Simonds","paypalEmail":"divinitycycle@gmail.com"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":213,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"18389_after.gif","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(\"xbox360achievements.org\") {\r\nbody #main_container{\r\n\twidth:100%!important;\r\n\tbackground-image:none!important;\r\n\tbackground-color: white!important;\r\n}\r\n#container_head{\r\n\twidth:100%!important;\r\n\theight:0px!important;\r\n\tbackground-color: white!important;\r\n}\r\n.header {\r\n\tbackground-image:none!important;\r\n\twidth:100%!important;\r\n\tmargin-left:0px!important;\r\n\theight:0px!important;\r\n\tbackground-color: white!important;\r\n}\r\n.head_menu {\r\n\tbackground-image:none!important;\r\n\twidth:100%!important;\r\n\theight:0px!important;\r\n\tmargin-left:0px!important;\r\n\tbackground-color: white!important;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbody { background-image: none!important;\r\n\tbackground-color: white!important;\t\r\n}\r\n.content {\r\n\tbackground-image:none!important;\r\n\tbackground-color: white!important;\r\n}\r\n}"}}
