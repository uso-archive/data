    "name": "FA - Easier to See Rating Borders",
    "description": "The current iteration of FA provides some subtle glowing effects.  On larger screens these colors appear dull-ish at times, and don't show up nicely, more specifically against the dark background.  Put together on a whim, this makes those borders bold, thick, brighter and easier to see.",
    "additionalInfo": "Version 1 Released\r\n- Basic borders added.\r\n- Crude new selection box added - solid white 1px box.\r\n- Altered the color of the mature border.\r\n- A a known bug is with the preview pane on user profiles where the username also gains the border.\r\n- A known but is with the selection box - borders are removed from the image, replaced with the old glow effect.  I can't quite figure out what it is that's altering this.\r\n- The current sizes of the elements result in some moving around depending on what image is hovered over.\r\n\r\nColor Reference:\r\nRed = Adult\r\nBlue = Mature\r\nBlack = General Audiences\r\n\r\nThin white BG - currently selected box (It's ugly but I couldn't figure out what would look nicer than the current selection box :/\r\n\r\nNo special instructions are needed - just start it up and let 'em rip!",
