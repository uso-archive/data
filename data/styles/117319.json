    "description": "Many DA members HATE the new CORE symbol, also known as DragonBall. I made a little tidbit which hides the new ugly CORE (premium and beta-tester), and inserts the old symbols, full star and outlined star behind usernames. It shows tool-tip like it used to, the color might be a little off in some places, but otherwise looks like it used to. The style works on deviantart.com and sta.sh. If you find any bug, or the style stops working, contact me (if you can't fix it yourself)! Confirmed working on Firefox and Android (Firefox). Thanks to BoffinbraiN and electricjonny on DeviantArt for fixes!",
    "additionalInfo": "Version 1.0 - Seems to have only have worked on my computer because I had already downloaded the fonts used by DeviantArt to my computer.\r\nVersion 1.2 - Implements the same font-call as DeviantArt uses to use online fonts.\r\nVersion 1.3 - Made the premium and beta tester stars slightly smaller, 85% of full size.\r\nVersion 1.4 - Revamped the code, got rid of redundant code (seems the source declaration was redundant, I just called the wrong font). :P Thanks to BoffinbraiN on Deviantart for fixes!\r\nVersion 2.0 - Now comes with tooltips and more intuitive coloring of the icons as in pre-CORE days. You should hardly notice that the change ever happened or that the script is even there!\r\nVersion 2.1 - Fixed some color codes to make the symbols show even more like they did before.",
