{"id":31403,"info":{"name":"Google Voice - Hide \"Do Not Disturb\" Notice","description":"I leave Google Voice in \"do not disturb\" mode all the time, since I do not use it for call screening; once my normal number hands it off to my Google Voice number, I want it to go to voicemail as quickly as possible.  This merely hides the \"'do not disturb' is on\" notice, since I always expect it to be on and it can be distracting from other messages Google Voice might be displaying in the same area.","format":"uso","category":"google","updatedAt":"2010-06-06T00:06:38.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":2444,"name":"WCityMike"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":241,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document url-prefix(\"http://www.google.com/voice\"), url-prefix(\"https://www.google.com/voice\") {\r\n#gc-dnd-display, .gc-dnd-display\r\n{\r\ndisplay: none !important\r\n}\r\n}"}}
