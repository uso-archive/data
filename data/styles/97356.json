    "description": "Allows you to select text when reading stories on FanFiction.Net. (FF.Net blocks selection of story text; this style undoes the block.) Balm for <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=compulsive%20highlighter\"> compulsive highlighters</a>, as well as users who want to select text to do something with it.",
    "additionalInfo": "After writing this style, I found out there were already a few <a href=\"http://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_terms=fanfiction+select\">similar styles on the site</a>. But I’m posting my user style anyway because my style’s source code also includes information on the source of the problem, and I like the name, description, and screenshot of mine a bit more than the others’. Also, the differently-worded title increases the chance that someone looking for a style like this will be able to find what they need.",
