    "description": "The idea behind many  of my styles   is to use minimum real estate for  toolbars. \r\n\r\n============================================================================\r\nSTYLE  NO  LONGER NEEDED ONCE YOU UPDATE  LAUNCHY\r\nLaunchy 4.3.0 finally changed icon, this style was created 2008-12-17 and is no longer needed as of 2010-01-27\r\nwill have to make some changes in my Navigation styles as well\r\n-- Style 10881 (10881)\r\n-- Style 18864 (18864)\r\n-- Style 9349 (9349)\r\nThere are some tweaks to Dom Inspector here as well, will check on them later\r\n==============================================================================",
    "additionalInfo": "One of my favorite extensions is the \"Launchy\" extension, but in Fx3 the  drop-down menu  was taking  up 3X the space of a normal button.  This style removes the unnecessary drop-down, simply left-click on the icon to see the drop-down list.  Without the style had to insert spaces into toolbar to left and above the icon.\r\n\r\nThe Launchy extension can be installed from https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/81 and can be used to bring up the current page in another application, such as another browser  (IE, Opera),  or editor (Notepad).\r\n\r\nFirefox Customizations (Notes)] Launchy Notes, opening Notepad and other applications\r\n-  http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/firefox.htm#launchy_notes \r\n\r\nExample of launchy.xml file \r\n- http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/code/launchy.txt  \r\n\r\nPicture from  Launchy button, Tools menu, or Context menu with web page as the object the items with an asterisk (*) and a number are those that I added specifically for my own applications and Firefox profiles, the rest were found by the extension itself.  Just to show that some things down with Windows Quick Launch can be done in Firefox.\r\n- http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/icons/ff_ext_launchy_browser.png \r\n- http://www.mvps.org/dmcritchie/firefox/quicklaunch.htm\r\n\r\nUpdates: since 2008-12-17\r\n(no  code changes)",
