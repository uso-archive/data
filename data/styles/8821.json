    "description": "Gives you Transparency on all Tooltips (Global style).\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8555 for this style to work!! **\r\n\r\n* Thanks to for introducing me into the realm of Transparency with style 4120\r\n\r\nYou can Customize the amount of transparency by editing the Opacity in the code (Closer to 0 is closer to invisible, whereas closer to 1 is closer to fully-visible - EXAMPLE: 0.5 is in the middle of opacity)\r\n\r\nThis makes your tooltips look really cool.\r\nThis style supports only Firefox3, giving it even more of a WOW effect!.\r\n\r\nApplies to:\r\n+ Navigation Toolbar (Hover over button)\r\n+ Hovering on a tab (tooltip will have radius)\r\n+ Also Applies to EVERY single item on any web page (Hover over a link)\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n+ This style has been tested on Multiple Themes! Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has rounded perfectly on each.\r\nFeel free to customize the transparency level (described above) ... no reposting mods though!\r\n* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8555 for this style to work!! **\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n+ Works only on Firefox3\r\n\r\nIntegrates with the following Styles:\r\n+ Style 8555\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8555 for this style to work!! **\r\n+ Style 8818\r\n+ Style 8558\r\n\r\nWorks well with:\r\n+ All of the Glasser / Transparent styles\r\n+ The Styles Displayed above\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.1\r\n+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.",
