{"id":19676,"info":{"name":"Google Analytics - Show longer pagenames hack","description":"On the page under https://www.google.com/analytics/reporting/top_content shows a longer table than in the original GA-design, so you can read on first sight most URLs and don't have to guess.\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n- Cannot give the moz-document url space, since the GA interface URL (ID) is different for every user. So it may(!) apply for more pages on the web.\r\n- Distorts the rest of the design a little bit.\r\n- Has impact on Wikipedia and GMX too, sadly. They use the same div-names. Just deactivate the style, when not using GA.","format":"uso","category":"global","updatedAt":"2009-07-21T13:48:49.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":5174,"name":"lestarte2008"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":312,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"19676_after.gif","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n/* (c) 2009 by Lestarte */\r\n\r\nobject[data*=\"content\"],\r\n\r\ntd [class=\"text\"], div [class=\"text_wrapper\"], a {\r\n  width:500px !important;\r\n  overflow:visible;\r\n}\r\n"}}
