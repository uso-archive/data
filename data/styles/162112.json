Does not affect the width, so there is no way something breaks on huge avatars.","format":"uso","category":"europebattle","updatedAt":"2018-07-03T18:29:15.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":673022,"name":"TrailBlazer Glitch"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"162112_after.png","isMainArchived":true},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document domain(\"forum.europebattle.net\") {\r\n.messageUserBlock .avatar img {\r\n    height: auto !important;\r\n}\r\n}"}}
