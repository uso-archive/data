Including NASA Night Launch, NASA Normal, and the Default Firefox 3 Theme.  It has rounded perfectly on each.\r\nFeel free to customize the transparency level (described above) ... no reposting mods though!\r\n* You will probably have to Restart your browser for this style's functionality to work completely.\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8414 for this style to work!! **\r\n\r\nBrowser Versions:\r\n+ Works on Firefox3\r\n+ Works on SongBird\r\n\r\nIntegrates with the following Styles:\r\n+ Style 8414\r\n** Must be installed along with Style 8414 for this style to work!! **\r\n+ Style 8028\r\n\r\nWorks well with:\r\n+ All of the Glasser (Vista Glass) / Transparent styles\r\n+ The Styles Displayed above\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n1.0.0.2:\r\n+ Updated code to work on Firefox 3.1 (Shiretoko) - No longer uses -moz-opacity, it is now just opacity.\r\n\r\n1.0.0.1\r\n+ Added Huge Update to decrease the transparency when your mouse hovers over the menus.\r\n+ This update makes the menus easier to read when your navigating them.\r\n+ You can customize this new feature to make them entirely opaque when hovering (or any other level of transparency)",
