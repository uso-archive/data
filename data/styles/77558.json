    "description": "Save your eyesight with this ultra-dark style that removes much of the glaring bright white background on Bloomberg's Businessweek.com. I am igor at http://techlorebyigor.blogspot.com and I code dark styles for several web sites. Wherever there is white, let us replace that with black. Note: I do not interfere with advertising. My focus here is on adjusting the brightness, nothing else.",
    "additionalInfo": "There is no end and no beginning, because there is light in the darkness and it renews all things. Life and death are not serious alternatives. We derive from and merge into the light through eternity, so there is no end to us and no beginning.",
