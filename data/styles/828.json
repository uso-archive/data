{"id":828,"info":{"name":"Website: cleaner - newegg.com","description":"This is a very simple style mod that removes all of the top, side, and bottom ads/banners\r\nfrom newegg.com, giving more screen real estate for browsing items, etc.  Now--of course, there\r\nmay be a few \"hot deals\" in those ad banners that you'll miss out on...but I've never found\r\nany.  This is probably not a very useful style, but there's a few people who may appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI also use adblock+, so keep that in mind if you still see ads.","format":"uso","category":"newegg","updatedAt":"2006-08-18T23:12:43.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":635,"name":"SKYY"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":1024,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"828-after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"/* SKYY's newegg cleaner */\r\n\r\n@namespace url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);\r\n\r\n@-moz-document domain(newegg.com)\r\n{\r\n\r\n[id=\"bottomAd1\"],[id=\"bannerAd1\"],[id=\"awards\"],[id=\"rightArea\"],[id=\"promotion\"]\r\n{\r\n\tdisplay: none !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n}"}}
