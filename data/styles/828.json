    "description": "This is a very simple style mod that removes all of the top, side, and bottom ads/banners\r\nfrom newegg.com, giving more screen real estate for browsing items, etc.  Now--of course, there\r\nmay be a few \"hot deals\" in those ad banners that you'll miss out on...but I've never found\r\nany.  This is probably not a very useful style, but there's a few people who may appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI also use adblock+, so keep that in mind if you still see ads.",
