    "description": "Remove the button that shifts the screen up and down while editing. So you can still edit emblems in battlelog without having to disable the Greaterfield extension. -for Jaku and emblem editers alike~ ^_^\r\ndoes not affect battlefield companion.\r\nPS. I can (probably) set the header where the buttons lay to a set size, so it doesn't move up and down as it loads if you really want the button to work? please leave a comment to let me know. :D",
