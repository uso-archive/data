    "description": "This style is a workaround for Bug 359769 where an <img> inside an element with display: -moz-inline-box caused a huge white space on the page and sometimes caused content to disappear. This is a trunk only issue that affects forums running CommunityServer software.\r\n\r\nOK, this isn't a great style but it's my first attempt at contributing to userstyles.org. I'll add more sites as I come across them.\r\n\r\nUpdate: This style is redundant since bug 359769 is fixed on trunk (as of 2007-01-23)",
