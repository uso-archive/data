    "description": "Only removes comment scores, not submission scores.  You can still upvote and downvote comments, it simply won't show the scores (karma).\r\n\r\nI wrote this with the intention of hopefully making people less worried about their comments being downvoted, forcing them to put less thought into the concept of karma while driving more attention to the discussion (like a forum is meant to be used).",
    "additionalInfo": "<b>Optional Change</b>: Only want to hide your own comment scores?  After installing, replace all of the CSS with this (replace <i>YourUsernameHere</i> with your reddit username):\r\n\r\n.comment .tagline .author[href*=\"/<i>YourUsernameHere</i>\"] ~ .score {\r\n    display: none !important;\r\n}",
