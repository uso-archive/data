{"id":36526,"info":{"name":"Garry's Blog -- No Background Opacity","description":"Basically, this removes the translucent background image that exists on Garry's blog (garry.tv). This isn't much, but it is something that annoys me, and I wouldn't be surprised if it annoyed anyone else.\r\n\r\nOverall, this makes the layout look cleaner and the text more readable. The color used on the background color is default for the Wordpress theme.","format":"uso","category":"garry","updatedAt":"2010-09-04T21:58:24.000Z","license":"NO-REDISTRIBUTION","author":{"id":61188,"name":"deadeye536"}},"stats":{"installs":{"total":66,"weekly":0}},"screenshots":{"main":"36526_after.png","isMainArchived":false},"discussions":{"stats":{"discussionsCount":0,"commentsCount":0}},"style":{"css":"@-moz-document domain('garry.tv'), domain('www.garry.tv') {\r\n    #main {\r\n    background-color: #F7F6F0 !important;\r\n    }\r\n}"}}
